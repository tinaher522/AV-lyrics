<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Whose_Hands_Are_These">
Whose hands are these 
That reach into a secret place 
Whose hands are these 
That brush across my sleeping face 
Like quiet waves, on silent shores 
Whose hands are these 
These hands are yours 
Whose name is called 
To find my soul in need of care 
Whose name is called 
To answer when that need is there 
A name that sings, who's music sours 
Whose name is called 
That name is yours 
When I need peace 
A quiet that belongs to me 
To be released 
From on a loud and angry scene 
I think of you 
Thinking of you quiets me 
As only you can do 
For me 
Whose eyes are these 
That see into this place I live 
Whose eyes are these 
Show me what Ive yet to give 
That see beyond unopened doors 
Whose eyes are these 
These eyes are yours 
Where do I go 
When not a door is open wide 
What can I know 
When questioned asked are un-replied 
I know of one 
One is all I need to confide 
To fill that place inside 
Of me 
Whose hands are these 
That touch me when my soul is bare 
Whose hands are these 
That offer all theyve got to share 
To show the way 
And stay the course 
Whose hands are these 
These hands are yours 
Whose hands are these 
These hands are yours
