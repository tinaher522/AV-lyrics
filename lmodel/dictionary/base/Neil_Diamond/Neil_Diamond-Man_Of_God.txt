<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Man_Of_God">
I'm a man of God
Though I never learned to pray
Walked the pathways of the heart
Found him there along the way
And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of faith
And faith is something you can't see
But if we want to make it through
Faith is how it's got to be
I'm thanking you Lord for giving me song
For making me strong
And for taking my hand
I'll go up to heaven when I reach the end
But up until then
Gonna do what I can
And I can, yes I can be a man of peace
Plant it like a tiny seed
It grows a little when you give
And gives you back when you're in need
No I am, yes I am, I'm a man of song
Gonna sing it far and near
Gonna make a joyful sound
One that every heart can hear
Singing for Him is like touching the sky
I don't need to know why
I just know that it is
Each time I sing out I want to rejoice
Cause when I hear my voice
I believe that it's His
And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of hope.
I haven't stopped believin' yet
And while we're headin' down that road
Hope is what we can't forget
And I am yes I am, I'm a man of God
Know I am, yes I am, I'm a man, I'm a man of faith
I'm a man, yes I am, I'm a man, I'm a man of peace
And I am, yes, I am, I'm a man, I'm a man of song
I'm a man of God
Man of God
