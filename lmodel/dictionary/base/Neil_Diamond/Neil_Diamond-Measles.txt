<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Measles">
I used to be the only boy
That you'd be found with
Now I can't even get close
You'd think I'd just come down
With measles
You think I had measles
"It gets much worse"
Though I was covered with little red spots
Oh, but baby...
All I really got is
The case of the blues.....
