<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Hurricane">
We were swept away,
We were taken by surprise
Was the power of the moment
Or the power of her eyes
Then it came unexpected,
And we never even ran
We were standing unprotected
When the rain began
And the hurricane came,
And it never made a sound
So we never ran for cover
And it blew the house down
And it brought us together
Maybe tore us all apart
When a hurricane blows
It goes for the heart
When a hurricane blows
It goes for the heart
When a hurricane blows
It goes for the heart
But we built another house
And we made it out of stone
And we're stronger now together
Than we ever were alone
We were swept away
But never swept apart
When a hurricane blows
It goes for the heart
When that hurricane blows
It goes for the heart
When that hurricane blows
It goes for the heart
For the heart
Was the power of the moment
Or the power of her eyes
Power of the moment
Or the power of her eyes
Swept away
Taken by surprise
Power of the moment
Or the power of her eyes
