<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Things_Have_Changed">
Now, you tell me I'm the only one
After all the dirty things you've done
Once there was a time
When I'd fall for your line,
But darlin'
Things have changed
I don't want your kisses anymore
No, we can't be lovers like before
When you left me all alone,
I went lookin' on my own
And darlin'
Things have changed
I found out what love's all about,
And I've taken the cue
All your lies I can do without
And so, I'd like to tell you
I've just found someone who really cares
We both plan to make a happy pair
I've just outgrown you
And there's nothing you can do
'Cause darlin'
Things have changed.
