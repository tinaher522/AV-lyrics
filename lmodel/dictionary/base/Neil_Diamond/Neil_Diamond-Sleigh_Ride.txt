<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Sleigh_Ride">
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "You hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Just look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintry fairy land
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like
Birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace
While we watch the chestnuts pop
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Come on ,it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Oh yeah, lovely weather
For a sleigh ride with you, with you
Me and you
Snuggle up closer babe
