<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Another_Day_(That_Time_Forgot)">
Another sunny afternoon
Denies the worried look that's on my face
Connected through the years
It somehow took us both in separate ways
Was on a day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no
Should've held you till the storm went by
We had nothing left to hang on to
Too many words you said 
But not the words connected me to you
Just another day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no
The two of us we both just let it fly
Didn't see it leave; didn't even try.
I only know that we were moving on
Suddenly it's gone; Heaven knows why.
Oh no
Oh no
Don't have a reason I can give 
At least not one that I can understand
Just somehow disappeared
It slipped beneath the fingers on my hand
It was on a day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no
We had it once, but we just let it fall
Should've held it close; could've had it all.
I'm thinking about the life we could have made
Lost the one we had somewhere along the way
Oh no
Oh no
I woke up all alone again
A half-remembered dream inside my head
You took me through the day
Followed me at night into my bed
It was a day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
