Written by: Neil Diamond
Hey little boy
Just sitting on your back porch
Picking on your guitar
Wishing you were far away
Well, I can tell
You've had a little bit fo a dream
I see it in your eyes
I can hear it in the songs you play
And hey little boy
Just play it like you feel it
Make it so real
It's almost to real to take
Just swing it like a player
Make it like a prayer
It's one from the heart
Give it all of the hear it can take
And when you play what you wanna play
Just reach down to the soul
You keep on growing and you'll know some day
That sound is gonna turn into gold
Boy, you're taking me there
To guitar heaven
And without saying a word
You lay it all on the line
And make me leave my cares
In guitar heaven
Just go and play your song
I could stay all night
Play it son
(guitar solo)
You know, you're taking me there
To guitar heaven
You make me feel every sound
You make it shine like a light
I'm gonna lose my cares
In guitar heaven
You go and play that song
I'm gonna stay a while
Go and play that song, boy
I'm gonna stay a while
The way you play that song
Makes me wanna smile
