<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Angels_We_Have_Heard_On_High">
Angels we have heard on high
Singing sweetly o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
What the glad song tidings be?
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the new-born King
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
