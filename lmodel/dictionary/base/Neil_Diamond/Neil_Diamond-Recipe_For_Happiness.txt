<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Recipe_For_Happiness">
For ev'ry guy who's got a girl
To aid him the social whirl,
I'd gladly give my recipe
I know it's good, it's worked for me
Take two hearts, a dash of tenderness
Mix them both and season with a kiss
That's the first part of my
Recipe for happiness
Take her smile,
Some yearning and desire,
Heat with love and soon,
You'll have a fire
You've almost got
My recipe for happiness
Hold her near at the proper time
Call her dear, it'll turn out fine
To reveal a touch of paradise,
Mix a ring, a dash of shoes and rice
Now you've found my
Recipe for happiness
