<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Angel_Above_My_Head">
If you're gonna be true to me
First, you've got to be true to yourself
Oh yeah
It don't matter 'bout nobody else
Oh, no
If it's there in your mind
It's a lesson I've just come to learn
Something
That I've only just begun to learn
Oh, yeah
For the very first time
For the very first time
Angel above my head
Calling my name in diff'rent places
Angel above my head
Saying it's alright
To show your face to the world
Everything seems new to me
Such a very recent turn of events
And the truth
Just doesn't make any sense
Oh, no
For the very first time
If we had another year or two
I would spend it being near to you
Oh, yeah
Like the very first time
Like the very first time
Angel above my head
Calling my name in diff'rent places
Angel above my head
Saying it's alright to show your face now
Angel above my head
Tapping me gently on my shoulder
That angel above my head
Saying it's time to be growing older
My friend
If you wanna be true to me
First you've got to be true to yourself
Oh, yeah
It don't matter 'bout nobody else
Oh, no
Keep me there in your mind
I'll be there by your side
