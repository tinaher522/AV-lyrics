<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Juliet">
Juliet I've been waitin',
For so long for you to come back
How I, I've been needin' you, Juliet.
Wrapped up all in day dreams,
But daydreams won't fill the night time.
And I'm so glad I found Juliet.
Nananananana...........
Turn your eyes on me, girl
Wanderin' round inside a grown man
No more than a small boy, sweet Juliet
'Bout to give up tryin'
And there you stood
Without your shoes on
You've gone and loved me, sweet Juliet
Nananananana...
