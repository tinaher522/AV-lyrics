<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Without_Her">
I spend the night in the chair
Thinking she'll be there but she never comes
I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise, to face another day without her, without her
It's just no good anymore
When you walk through the door of an empty room
Then you go inside and set a table for one
It's no fun you spend a day without her, without her
We burst the pretty balloon, It took us to the moon
It's such a beautiful thing,
But it's ended now and it sounds like a lie
If I said I'd rather die, than live without her, without her
Love is a beautiful thing
When it knows how to swing and it moves like a clock
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
It's breaking my heart, to be without her, without her
We burst the pretty balloon
It took us to the moon, it's such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now and it sounds like a lie
If I said I'd rather die than live without her, without her
Love is a beautiful thing
When it knows how to swing and it moves like a clock
The hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
It's breaking my heart to be without her, without her
Can't go on without her, without her
There's no song without her, without her
It's all wrong without her, without her
Can't go on without her, without her
