<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Take_Care_Of_Me">
The first time
Caught you stayin' out late
With some bad boys
The first time
And you got mad
When I asked you to explain it.
Say it isn't so,
I need you to say it isn't so
And I'll believe it
Say it isn't so
Just say it isn't so
And that I'm dreamin'
You said "Take care of me"
You begged me now
"Take care of me"
And I believed it
"Take care of me"
It's me or nothin' girl
"Take care of me"
The next time,
I was out by myself at the movie
That was the last time
Found you there
With some fast talkin' smoothie
Say it isn't so
I need you to say
That I don't see what I'm seein'
Say it isn't so
Just say it isn't true,
That you would cheat me
You said "Take care of me"
You kept on beggin' me
"Take care of me"
And I believed it, yeah
"Take care of me"
Now it's your turn to take care of me
Don't beg me one more time
"Take care of me"
You said it now
"Take care of me"
That you needed me
"Take care of me"
And I believed your lies
"Take care of me"
You know that now you've got to....
"Take care of me"
You gonna miss me honey
You gonna know it too
Forget the high times
You said "Take care of me"
Take care of me
Take care of me
Take care of me
You did me dirty
You treated me bad
Look what I am today, baby....
