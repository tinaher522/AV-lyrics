<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Straw_In_The_Wind">
Babe, I feel like a straw in the wind
Don't know where I stand
Can't say where I'm goin'
Or where I've been,
Or even if I'm your man
Ah, Girl, I never know
Whether I'm out or in
Oh, oh, I'm cold
And I'm a straw in the wind
Hey, hey, hey
Sometimes I feel like a ship on the sea
Tossin' and turnin' all night
I know if you hold your hand out to me
Yeah, everything could be alright
Ah, Girl, I never know
Whether I'm out or in
Oh, oh,
I'm cold and I'm a straw in the wind
Ah, Girl, I never know
Whether I'm out or in
Oh, oh,
I'm cold and I'm a straw in the wind
Yeah, I'm a straw in the wind
