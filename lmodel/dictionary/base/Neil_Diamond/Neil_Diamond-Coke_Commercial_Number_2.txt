Girl, you know that I love you
But, I need time to think
And you know I can't think
When you're sitting this close to me
Can't we talk about wedding bells
Some other time?
If you get any closer,
I'll go out of my mind
Sit back, have a Coke and relax
Sit back, have a Coke and relax, babe
Things go better with,
You'll go better with,
I feel better with Coca Cola, yeah
Sit back, have a Coke and relax
Sit back, baby
Sit back, have a Coke and relax
Sit back, have a Coke and relax
Sit back, have a Coke and relax
