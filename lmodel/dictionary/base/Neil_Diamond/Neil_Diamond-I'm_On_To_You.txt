<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="I'm_On_To_You">
Lie no more, I'm on to you
Know the score and I'm on to you
Take anything you want
Baby, I'm movin' on
You can complain, rant and cry
Can't deny
Baby, I'm on to you
Talk your talk, I'm on to you
Like a hawk, hey, I'm on to you
Trouble is what you are
Trouble that's gone too far
Baby, the truth makes you free
Disagree... I'll still be on to you
Tell me now how I was wrong
And I'll tell you how right you are
Wrong to be stayin' so long
Was I out of my head?
Should have known it was dead
But it's good
By now, I'm on to you
Stood my ground, hey, I'm on to you
Baby, I wish you well
But loving you, it was hell
Now is the time to let go
Finally know, that I'm so on to you
Tell me now how I was wrong
And I'll tell you how right you are
Wrong to be staying so long
Was I out of my head?
Should have known it was dead
But it's good by now, I'm on to you
Stood my ground, hey, I'm on to you
Baby I wish you well
But lovin' you hurt like hell
And it's the time to let go
Finally know that I'm so on to you
Baby I'm on to you
Saying I'm on to you
To you
To you
To you
To you
Sayin' I wish you well
But lovin' you, it was hell
And it's the time to let go
Finally know that I'm so on to you
Baby I'm on to you
Saying I'm on to you
Knowin' I'm on to you
Baby, I'm on to you
