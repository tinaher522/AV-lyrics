Written by: Neil Diamond
Believe me
I'm someone who believes in you
Say, you really had a million dollars
And a car for every day of the week
So what? You know what?
It wouldn't mean not a single thing
Without that someone
Who believes it too
Yeah, you gotta have someone
Who believes in you
Say, you really had a hollywood contract
And your face up on the big billboard
Big car, big star
You'd move a lot, but you wouldn't get far
Without that someone
Who believes it too
You better have someone
Who believes in you
You are the truest part of me
That quiet place where I can be strong
You come to fill my deepest needs
You call my name, and I hear your song
Believe me
There's someone who believes in you
So, you really got the hots for stardom
All you need is some big guitar
To take you, and make you
Into an overnight star
And then you'll find that
Stars get lonesome too
And you better have someone
Who believes in you
You are the truest part of me
That tender place where I can be strong
You come to fill my deepest needs
You speak my name, and I hear your song
So you really want a job in the circus
Paint you face and make the people smile
A clown, come on down
You've been too long walking that high wire
When you're falling, you'll be calling to
Be calling out to someone who believes you
Someone who's there when nobody needs you
Calling out to someone who believes in you
