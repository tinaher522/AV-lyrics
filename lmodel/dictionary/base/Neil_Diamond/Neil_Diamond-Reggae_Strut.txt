<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Reggae_Strut">
Some dey do, some dey don't do
Some dey won't do,,
Some won't even try
How are you to know
You got to go and ask it
How are you go and ask it
Maybe you move it by
Pardon me
Maybe you like to dance it
Maybe you like to chance it
Maybe you like to try
Maybe lady do Reggae Strut
Maybe lady she do okay
Maybe lady do Reggae
Making de hips sway, movin' it okay
Some dey wait, some dey can't wait
Some dey won't wait
Some don't even try
Try like me, pick up the elbow higher
Kick up de foot and glide it
You got to dance it by
Maybe lady do Reggae Strut
Maybe lady she do okay
Maybe lady do Reggae
Making de hips sway, movin' it okay
Dat's de way, you got the right motion
You got the right notion
Now maybe you dance it by
Hey de lady do Reggae Strut
Hey de lady she do okay
Hey de lady do Reggae
Making the hips sway, movin' it okay
