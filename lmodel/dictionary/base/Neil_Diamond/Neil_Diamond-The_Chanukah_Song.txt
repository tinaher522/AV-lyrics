<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Chanukah_Song">
There are so many beautiful Christmas songs around and so few Hanukah songs
So I thought we'd try this one for you
Put on your yamakah,
Here comes Hanukah,
So much funikah to celebrate Hanukah here
Hanukah is,
The festival of lights,
Instead of one day of presents we have eight crazy nights!
When you feel like the only kid in town,
Without a Christmas tree,
Here's a list of people who are Jewish,
Just like you and me!
David Lee Roth,
Lights the Menorah,
So do James Cann, Kirk Douglas and the late Dinah Shora,
Guess who eats together at the Carnegi Deli,
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzarelli!
Paul Newman is half Jewish,
Goldie Hawn is too,
Put them both together what a FINE looking Jew!
You don't have to Deck the Halls with Jingle Bell Rock,
'cause you can spin a dreidel with Captian Kirk and Mr. Spock!
(both Jewish!)
Put on your yamakah,
Here comes Hannukah,
Some much funikah to
Celebrate Hanukah!
OJ Simpson,
Not a Jew!
But guess who is?,
Hall o' Famer Rod Carew!
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby,
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish!
Not too shabby!
Some people think that
Ebenezer Scrooge is,
Well he's not but guess who is?
All three Stooges!!!
So many Jews are on my list
Tom Cruise isn't,
But Jesus Christ is!
Put on your yamakah,
Here comes Hannukah,
So much funikah to
Celebrate Hanukah here!
Hanukah is,
The festival of lights,
Instead of one day of presents we have eight crazy nights!
So tell your friend Veronica,
Its time to celebrate Hanukah!
And don't forget harmonica,
On this lovely, lovely Hanukah!
So drink your gin and tonicah,
Don't smoke your marijuanikah!
If you really, really wannukah,
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy,
HANUKAH!
Oh yes
Happy Hanukah You'all
