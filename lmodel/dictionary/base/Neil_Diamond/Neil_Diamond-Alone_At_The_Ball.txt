<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Alone_At_The_Ball">
Need a life with a set of directions
Get it right with a few small corrections
Find a groove, you just got to stay with it
Got to move, it's your life got to live it
Spirit down, look around
There's a cold wind a-blowin'
Being strong's what you long for
But you've got to show it
You're too vain to complain and ashamed
No one knows you at all
And you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball
Got a car, Cadillac El Dorado
Take it far, up to high Colorado
Got to move, it's your life got to live it
Find a groove then you got to stay with it
Hey this life's all about striking out, taking chances
What's the point of it all, if you call no one answers
Spend your time makin' rhyme
Just to find no one dancing at all
Then you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball
Sing your song, move along
'Cause the future awaits you
Free your brain from the chains
That remain to enslave you
Took your hits, kept your wits
Never flinched stayed yourself through it all
Now you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball
All alone, at the ball
You're all alone
Alone at the ball
You're all alone
Alone at the ball
