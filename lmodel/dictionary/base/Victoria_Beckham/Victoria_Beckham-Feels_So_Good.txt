<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Feels_So_Good">
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop (ooh yeah)
Don't stop rockin' baby
Don't stop
I've been waiting all week long
To dance and have some fun
I can't wait to see
My girls out with me
Hit the spot around eight
You know we cant be late
Cos all the guys are ready
For all the girls to start shakin'
The weekend's here, we gotta get it right (get it right)
We gotta keep it going all night (all night long)
Bring it on baby till the break of dawn
Cos it's time to set it off, throw em off, it's on
So don't stop rockin' me tonight
You know you make it feel so good
Like you know it should
Do it baby anyway you like
Cos you know you make it feel so good
You make it feel so good
There's a hot one on the floor
Work it baby give me more
Eye to eye with me
No place I'd rather be
??? -------- comin' round
??? Get partner and get down
Gonna have a good time
Come with me and we'll be fine
The weekend's here, we gotta get it right (get it right)
We gotta keep it going all night (all night long)
Bring it on baby till the break of dawn (bring it on baby, oh)
Cos it's time to set it off, throw em off, it's on, yeah
Don't stop rockin' me tonight (rockin' me tonight)
You know you make it feel so good (make it feel)
Like you know it should
Do it baby anyway you like (do it)
Cos you know you make it feel so good
You make it feel so good (feel so good)
Don't stop rockin' me tonight (oh)
You know you make it feel so good (you know you make it, it feels, so good)
Like you know it should (you know it should)
Do it baby anyway you like
Cos you know you make it feel so good
You make it feel so good 
Make it feel so good
Like I know it should
Make it feel
Make it feel so good
You know you make me feel
Like I know it should
(You make it feel so good)
Don't stop rockin' me tonight
You know you make it feel so good (oh yeah, yeah)
Like you know it should
Do it baby anyway you like (oh, yeah)
Cos you know you make it feel so good (oh yeah, yeah)
You make it feel so good (oh yeah)
Don't stop (oh yeah, yeah)
Don't stop 
Don't stop rockin' me (oh yeah)
Don't stop 
Don't stop (oh yeah, yeah)
Don't stop (oh yeah)
Don't stop (oh yeah, yeah)
