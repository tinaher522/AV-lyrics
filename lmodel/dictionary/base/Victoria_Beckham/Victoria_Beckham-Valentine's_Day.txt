Valentine's Day
Breezy promises
Waste of time is all he was, oh
Said that we'd be down for life
Tellin' lies to make everything alright
The 14th I would take your hand
Bringin' you up would be our little man
Those were the plans we made
When the whole time he was a liar
Seeing is believing
There'll be no me on this Valentine's day
Yeah, oh-oh  (Valentine's day)
I can't take it no more
He'll be alone on this Valentine's day, baby (baby)
The funny thing is that you had my heart
Never dreamed that we would be apart
Fool in love that I was
And soon that all would disappear
To you it was a game
And I am the one to blame
I told you that I would leave
And clearly you didn't believe me
Seeing is believing (seeing it, no)
There'll be no me on this Valentine's day 
Yeah, oh-oh (oh yeah)
I can't take it no more
(I can't take it no more, no)
He'll be alone on this Valentine's day, baby 
(baby, whoa-oh)
Seeing is believing (seeing is believing)
There'll be no me on this Valentine's day
Yeah, oh-oh
I can't take it no more
He'll be alone on this Valentine's day, baby 
(baby, no whoa)
I don't wanna receive no roses
Better yet don't want a simple call from you
No I don't, no I don't, no
All my cryin' days I spent are over
The only one I ever trusted boy was you
No more apologies or I love you's
Seeing is believing (seeing is believing)
There'll be no me on this Valentine's day 
Yeah, oh-oh (baby no it won't no)
I can't take it no more
He'll be alone on this Valentine's day, baby
(All of the pressure an' all of the strain you put on me, no I won't, no I won't)
Seeing is believing (I'm gonna walk out the door)
There'll be no me on this Valentine's day 
Yeah, oh-oh (I'm tired of all the crying, oh yeah)
I can't take it no more (I can't take it no more)
He'll be alone on this Valentine's day, baby
