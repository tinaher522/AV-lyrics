<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Generate_The_Flow">
I wanna get a reaction
I wanna play with your mind
I'm gonna make a connection
I'm gonna make you mine
I need a little attention
I need a little desire
A little love and affection
Watch me blow your mind
So c'mon, get it as quick as you can
I wanna see you get it, so we can get down
I wanna little dirty with the family man
Take a chance tonight
So c'mon flow
Let your body let go
Let your body move up and down
Let it get down to the sound
And flow, with your body and soul
You can take me round and round
So lose your mind and generate the flow
I want satisfaction
Don't be wasting my time
A bit of physical attraction
Your body next to mine
A bit of sweet seduction
Put your ass on the line
Sexual corruption
Is playing on my mind
So c'mon and get it as quick as you can
I wanna see you get it, so we can get down
I wanna little dirty with the family man
Take a chance tonight
So c'mon flow
Let your body let go
Let your body move up and down
Let it get down to the sound
And flow, with your body and soul
You can take me round and round
So lose your mind and generate the flow
So c'mon flow
Let your body let go
Let your body move up and down
Let it get down to the sound
And flow (c'mon baby), with your body and soul (c'mon darling)
You can take me round and round
So lose your mind and generate the flow
C'mon baby
C'mon darling (And generate the flow)
(And generate the flow)
C'mon baby
C'mon darling (And generate the flow)
And generate the flow
