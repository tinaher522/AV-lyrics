Ooh-Ooh
Yeah-Yeah
I never knew that we were through
I was too fallen and fallen for you
You walked away, out of my life, nothing to say
Couldn't deny, or ask you why
Why you were telling me lie after lie
Without a sign, no longer mine, it was good-bye
Did you think I couldn't live without you?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
And listen baby, I, I was right to doubt you
I can live without you by my side
(Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter
(Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall
(Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger
(Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all
I have no fear, my conscience is clear
Won't let your memory drive me to tears
Suddenly now, I understand why you are gone
A bittersweet revenge, in the end
Is a heart that can grow on command
Take it from me, I'm mov-ing on.
Did you think I couldn't live without you?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Now listen baby, I, I was right to doubt you
I can live without you by my side
(Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter
(Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall
(Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger
(Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all
I've been thinking about you night and day
All the time that we spent, just thrown away
I've been thinking about how you tried to break my heart
Now I've finally found the strength to say
That letting you go is the only way
I've decided today is the day to move on
Did you think I couldn't live without you?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Now listen baby, I, I was right to doubt you
I can live without you by my side
(Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter
(Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall
(Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger
(Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all
(Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter
(Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall
(Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger
(Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
