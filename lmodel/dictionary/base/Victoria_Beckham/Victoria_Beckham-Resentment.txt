<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Resentment">
I wish I could believe him
Ooh, yeah
I wish I could believe you
Then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way, I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied
And it's all
Because you lied
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
But I, just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
Don't know why you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
Oh it ain't the same, no
As before this woman came
I loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrifice
When you broke
Your word that night
I only gave you a hard time
Cos I can't go on and pretend, like
I don't remember feeling
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
(yeah)
I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for 5 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you're probably thinkin'
What's up with me?
This sounds like a 50's record
That's alright with me, yeah
Oh,
ooh,
No, no
