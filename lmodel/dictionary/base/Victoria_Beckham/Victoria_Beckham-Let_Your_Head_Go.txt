<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Let_Your_Head_Go">
From the river to the waterfall
Let the music flow
Through your fingers, feel the energy
Shake your very soul
And when it feels so good
I can almost lose my mind
When it feels so good
Oooh, it makes me crazy every time
Let your head go
Shake your body free
'cause tonight the beat's gonna getcha
Let your head go
Baby trip for me
One more time, I will make it better
(Better)
I will make it better
From the dance floor to your fantasy
Gonna break it down
In my system deep inside of me
Gotta let it out
And when it feels so good
I can almost lose my mind
When it feels so good
Oooh, it makes me crazy every time
Let your head go
Shake your body free
'cause tonight the beat's gonna getcha
Let your head go
Baby trip for me
One more time, I will make it better
Let your head go
Shake your body free
'cause tonight the beat's gonna getcha
Let your head go
Baby trip for me
One more time, I will make it better
(Better)
I will make it better
And when it feels so good
I can almost lose my mind
When it feels so good
Oooh, it makes me crazy every time
Let your head go
Shake your body free
'cause tonight the beat's gonna getcha
Let your head go
Baby trip for me
One more time, I will make it better
Let your head go
Shake your body free
'cause tonight the beat's gonna getcha
Let your head go
Baby trip for me
One more time, I will make it better
