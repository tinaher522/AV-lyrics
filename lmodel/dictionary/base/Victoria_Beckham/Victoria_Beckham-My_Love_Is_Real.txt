<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="My_Love_Is_Real">
Do i need to say it?
You should know my love is for real
(for real, yeah)
Don't make me explain it
You should know the way that i feel
Got me - warm heart feeling baby
Swear my heart stop beating baby
Do i need to say it?
You should know my love is for real
My love is for real
That's how i play it
Let the tingling grow inside me
Love thy precious gold inside me
(call me)
When your love comes creapin? baby
(call me)
Got me non-stop freakin' baby
Do i need to say it?
You should know my love is for real
My love is for real
Thats how it's stayin?
Let your warmth unfold invite me
Love thy precious gold inside me
Evertime i dance
Wanna make a little love
Evertime i dance
Wanna make a little love
Do i need to say it?
You should know my love is for real
Don't make me explain it
You should know the way that i feel
