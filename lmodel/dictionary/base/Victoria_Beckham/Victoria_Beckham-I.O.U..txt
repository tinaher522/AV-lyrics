<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="I.O.U.">
Love is such a precious gift
One thing in my life I know is true
And I.O.U.
Deeper than the ocean bed
You touch me like no one could ever do
I.O.U.
And I never could repay that look that's in your eyes
I could save up all my kisses 'til the end of time
All my love in my life 'til it's through
I.O.U.
Love is such a precious gift
The currency of life I never knew
Now I.O.U.
Keep it for eternity
The vow I made the day I said "I do"
I.O.U.
And I never could repay that look that's in your eyes
So, to pledge myself to you would be no sacrifice
All my love in my life 'til it's through, 
I.O.U.
You lay me down on hallowed ground with one touch of your hand
Hold me like a baby, that's when suddenly I understand
All that you do, I owe it to you
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U.
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U.
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U.
And I never could repay that look that's in your eyes
I could save up all my kisses 'til the end of time
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U
(Baby, baby I.O.U.
One thing I know is true
Baby, baby I.O.U.
I.O.U., I.O.U.)
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U
