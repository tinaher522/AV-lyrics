<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="I._O._U.">
Love is such a precious gift
One thing in my life I know is true
And i.o.u.
Deeper than the ocean
You touch me like no one could ever do
I.o.u.
Chorus:
And I never could replace the look that's in your eyes
I could save up all my kisses till the end of time
All my love in my life 'til it's through, i.o.u
Love is such a precious gift
The currency of life I never knew
Now i.o.u.
Keep it for eternity
The vow I made the day I said "i do"

I.o.u.
And I never could repay the look that's in your eyes
So to pledge myself to you would be no sacrifice
All my love in my life 'til it's through, i.o.u.
You lay me down on hallowed ground with one touch of your hand
You hold me like a baby, that's when suddenly I understand
All that you do, I owe it to you
All my love in my life 'til it's true, I .o.u. (x2)
And I never could repay the look that's in your eyes
I could save up all the kisses 'til the end of time
So to pledge myself to you would be no sacrifice
All my love in my life 'til it's true, i.o.u.
