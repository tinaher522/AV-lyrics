<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Can't_Get_Enough_Of_You_Dj">
Can't get enough of you DJ (in the club tonight)
Think I'm in love with you DJ
Can't get enough of you DJ (in the club tonight)
Think I'm in love with you DJ
Everybody in the club tonight
Dance into this magic of the light
I think I'm gonna make my move tonight
No more waiting, think the time is right
I ain't thinking about my man tonight
Cos the DJ's playing on my mind
No I can't let him out of my sight
You know the DJ drives me crazy, yeah-yeah
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you mister DJ
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you, love you, love you DJ
Think I wanna take you home tonight
Make sweet love upon your decks tonight
We can do it till the time is right
And if you're ready spin it one more time
Cos the rhythm makes you feel alive
Yes it makes you feel so alive
Baby give it to me one more time
You know that DJ drives me crazy, yeah-yeah
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you mister DJ
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you, love you, love you DJ
Ooh baby, baby, I like it
I love the way you spin the baby
Ooh baby, baby, I like it
You know I love you mister DJ, oh-oh
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you mister DJ
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you, love you, love you DJ
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you mister DJ
Can't get enough of you DJ
I just love the way you play, oh-oh
Think I'm in love with you DJ
I love you DJ
