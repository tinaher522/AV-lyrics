<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="That_Kind_Of_Girl">
Boy when I first saw u - knew I could adore u
And it's my nature to be shy but not tonight
So let me make the first move - make it easy for you
Someone has to break the ice, oh Oh
Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
Cos' my affection ain't something you can buy
Got my suspicions by lookin in your eyes
That you could be my kind of guy
Do you like watchin the sun come up
Sippin champagne in a paper cup
Laughing when you're makin love (oh baby)
Cos' I'm that kind of girl
dancin' to a sad love song
Even when the music's gone
kisses that go on and on and on
Cos I'm that kind of girl
Is this first star wishing or woman's intuition
Has my arrow found its mark? Oh! Baby
Cos' all I do is think of you in a fantasy for two
And I've just got to let you know
Cos' being real is in my heart and soul
Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
Cos' my affection ain't something you can buy
Got my suspicions by lookin in your eyes
That you could be my kind of guy
I wanna be kissin in the rain
Fallen in love over and over again
I want the pleasure and not the pain
Cos I'm that kind of girl
