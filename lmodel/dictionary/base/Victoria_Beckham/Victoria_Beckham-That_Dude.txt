Don't mess with that dude
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't mess with that dude
If he's too young, some of them guys got a real big problem
Startin' shit they can't finish if you allow them
To get close enough to think you can't live without them
Don't mess with that dude
Say the rule applies to the next type
Insecurity, he's trying to control your life
Tired of feeling scared, somebody gon' come along and treat you right, no
Don't mess with that dude
Cos he's already taken
I don't give a damn what kinda plans you're makin'
Even if the playa says he's plannin on shakin'
Bottom line is he's still takin' so
Don't mess with that dude
And if you're smart you'll leave him alone
He ain't even thinkin' about getting his own
Not a car, not a job, not a place of his own
Comfortable at his mom's tho
Don't mess with that dude
And if he don't wanna pay the bills he have run up then
Don't mess with that dude
And if he lounge at the place while you're workin'I'd a come up here
Don't mess with that dude
And if he lazy, trite, and jealous, and got a wife then
Don't mess with that dude
And if he's all of the above, I'm gonna say it twice then
Don't mess with that dude
Cos it's only a matter of time before he breaks your heart
Don't mess with that dude
And I know it's not easy for ya to play this part but
Don't mess with that dude
If he promise you happiness but he made you cry
Said he'd be true to you but he told you lies
You're willin to work with him but he just won't try
Don't mess with that dude
And when you're on to the next
Good guy, good background, good sex
Kick it for a minute but if he won't take steps
Pause givin you his last name, yet
Don't mess with that dude
If you got a man then his boys are strictly off limits
If they make noise your style will be diminished
Tell him where to go if he's tryin to cash his feelings, yeah
Don't mess with the dude
And if your man's ever weak enough to be hittin' you
Recognize, real, and take in what I've given you
You don't deserve it, you're worth so much more than abuse
Don't mess with the dude
I know the game, I know the rules now
Don't mess with that dude
I heard the lies, I know the truth now
Don't mess with that dude
I've been alone and I been misused
Don't mess with that dude
Now I know what I gotta do, yeah
Don't mess with that dude
Don't mess with that dude
Cos it's only a matter of time before he breaks your heart
Don't mess with that dude
And I know it's not easy for ya to play this part but
Don't mess with that dude
