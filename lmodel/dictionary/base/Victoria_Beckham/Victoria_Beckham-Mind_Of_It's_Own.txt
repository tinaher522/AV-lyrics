<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Mind_Of_It's_Own">
Stop, slow down, take a deep breath
Yeah
Stop, slow down, take a deep breath
I look at you and I know you're trouble
I should run just fast as I can
Yeah, one smile, game over
Here in front of you I stand
I know, you're only gonna burst my bubble
Trouble is, my heart don't care
It's ignoring all the danger signs
Stop, slow down, take a deep breath, beware
I'm not willing to be so fearless, careless, just yet
Cos' once bitten twice shy is what you get
My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Cos' when it breaks, I break
I don't know how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Too many times, I've witnessed
My heart make a fool of itself
So sure it's gonna turn out one way
Always turns out being somethin' else
My hearts got a real malfunction
Always flippin' into over ride
When I tell it to be sensible
It over rules my cynical mind
I'm not willing to be so open, transparent, no, not yet
Cos' once bitten twice shy is what you get
But here in front of you there's nothin' I can do
My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Cos' when it breaks I break
I don't know how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Cos' when it breaks I break
I don't know how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Stop, slow down, take a deep breath
Think about what I'm doin'
Think about once bitten, twice shy
Stop, slow down, take second
Before you rust right in
It's gonna be our tears we cry
My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Cos' when it breaks I break
I don't know how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Cos' when it breaks I break
I don't know how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
My hearts got a mind of it's own
My hearts got a mind of it's own
My hearts got a mind of it's own
My hearts got a mind of it's own
