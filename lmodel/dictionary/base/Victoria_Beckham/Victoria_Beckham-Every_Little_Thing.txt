<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Every_Little_Thing">
Oh whoa
When you want it, gotta have it,
Wanna have a little more
When you've done it, got up on it
Everybody knows the score
All I want is somebody to walk by my side everyday in the sun
All I need is somebody to be there to show me just where I belong 
Every little thing that you say and do
Every little thing it makes me fall for you
No one can stop us tonight
Every little thing that you do and say
Every single word, it takes me far away
No one can stop us tonight
Everything will be alright
When I need it, I believe it
You gotta give it a try (give it a try)
I can breathe it, I really feel it
And it's making me so high
All I want is somebody to walk by my side everyday in the sun
All I need is somebody to be there to show me just where I belong
Every little thing that you say and do
Every little thing it makes me fall for you
No one can stop us tonight (tonight)
Every little thing that you do and say
Every single word, it takes me far away
No one can stop us tonight
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Right now, give it to me
Right now, give it to me
Right now, wanna get on
Right now, give it to me
Right now, give it to me
Right now, baby come on
Every little thing that you say and do
Every little thing it makes me fall for you
No one can stop us tonight (no no)
Every little thing that you do and say
Every single word, it takes me far away
No one can stop us tonight
Everything will be alright
Every little thing that you say and do
Every little thing it makes me fall for you
No one can stop us tonight
Every little thing that you do and say
Every single word, it takes me far away
No one can stop us tonight
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
