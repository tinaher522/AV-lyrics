<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Should_Have_Known_Better">
I should have thought a little harder
But I don't know why
I should have moved a little faster
But I was denied
Could have stayed a little longer
Could have tried, oh no no
But you were the dream and baby
And that's the reason why
Each time I see you and the feelings go stronger
But this time I'm leaving cause I love you no longer
Feels like I'm drowning as you're dragging me under
And I can't hold on
I should've known better
Than to spend my life waiting for you
You know it's hard following after
When you treat me the way that you do
I should've known better
Than to spend my life waiting for you
And now my heart's broken forever
And your promises never came true
I didn't need to forget you
But you weren't around, oh no no
I didn't feel I could trust you
Or keep your feet on the ground
Each time I see you and the feelings go stronger
But this time I'm leaving cause I love you no longer
Feels like I'm drowning as you're dragging me under
And I can't hold on
I should've known better
Than to spend my life waiting for you
You know it's hard following after
When you treat me the way that you do
I should've known better
Than to spend my life waiting for you
And now my heart's broken forever
And your promises never came true
Da da, da da da da, da da
Da da, da da da da, da da
Da da da da
Each time I see you and the feelings go stronger (Go stronger)
But this time I'm leaving cause I love you no longer (I love you no longer)
Feels like I'm drowning as you're dragging me under
And I can't hold on
I (I) should've known better (should've known better)
Than to spend my life waiting for you (waiting for you)
You know it's hard following after
When you treat me the way that you do
I (I) should've known better (should've known better)
Than to spend my life waiting for you (waiting for you)
And now my heart's broken forever
And your promises never came true
Da da, da da, da da da da da
Da da, da da, da da da da da
