<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Open_Your_Eyes">
(Open your eyes
See the sun touch the blue sky
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See the sun touch the blue sky
Open your eyes)
I need to know what's going on
How something right could be so wrong
You're moving closer all the time
How can I make you change your mind
Open your eyes
See the sun touch the blue sky
Open your eyes
You're feeling alive
Like the stars shining so bright
Open your eyes
'Cause seeing is believing
Baby, stop your dreaming
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
To the world for the first time
Open your eyes
'Cause seeing is believing
Baby, stop your dreaming
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
To the world for the first time
Open your eyes
You wake up to the morning sun
Forget the past, your time has come
Don't let this moment slip away
You found the place you want to stay
Open your eyes
See the sun touch the blue sky
Open your eyes
You're feeling alive
Like the stars shining so bright
Open your eyes
'Cause seeing is believing
Baby, stop your dreaming
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
To the world for the first time
Open your eyes
'Cause seeing is believing
Baby, stop your dreaming
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
To the world for the first time
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
(Open your eyes
See the sun touch the blue sky
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See the sun touch the blue sky
Open your eyes)
