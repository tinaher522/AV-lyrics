<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="I'd_Give_It_All_Way">
I got this feeling and it's driving me wild
I haven't seen you for a little while
I got this feeling and it just won't go away (just won't go away)
Then you came
And showed me
How to love this way
But there's one thing
That I should let you know
I'd give it all away (I'd give it all away)
I'd sacrifice everything (I'd sacrifice everything)
With every beat of my heart
Like you i couldn't breathe
I feel like we're meant to be (I feel like we're meant to be)
I'm falling in love again (I'm falling in love again)
Holding me close in your arms
With you is where i should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Feels like I'm dreaming and I can't wake up
We have forever but it's never enough
Feels like I'm dreaming cos I can't believe it's real
You taught me
And showed me
How to love this way
But there's one thing
I ought to let you know
I'd give it all away (I'd give it all away)
I'd sacrifice everything (I'd sacrifice everything)
With every beat of my heart
Like you i couldn't breathe
I feel like we're meant to be (I feel like we're meant to be)
I'm falling in love again (I'm falling in love again)
Holding me close in your arms
With you is where i should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
Where I should be
