Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout (oh oh)
Whatcha talkin' bout (oh oh)
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout (what what what)
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
I remember talking to you constantly
'Cause we were cool like that
Playing silly games with you, we had a ball
Going to the movies, or just hangin' out
Watching a DVD
But now it's let's do lunch
The limo's pickin' you up around three
Sayin' hit me on my mobile
I'm a little busy
Got a lot a people to call (oh-whoa you)
Whatcha talkin' bout, I don't really hear it
Cos you keep on fadin' out
You're not comin' through, whatcha gon' do? (gon' do?)
Whatcha talkin' bout, who you think you're fooling? (oh)
There's no way I'm hangin' out
With someone like you, whatcha gon' do?
It started when the fame and fans kept coming in
And then you changed on us
Then you told us you were cool and we were wrong
When I call you on the phone
You act like you ain't home
Checkin' your caller ID
Now I've seen it all
Why you getting fake on me
Know you gotta lot of problems
And you need to solve them
But it's not gonna be with me around (with me around, no-oh)
Whatcha talkin' bout, I don't really hear it (no, oh)
Cos you keep on fadin' out
You're not comin' through, whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha talkin' bout, who you think you're fooling?
There's no way I'm hangin' out (oh, oh)
With someone like you, whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha talkin' bout, I don't really hear it (what, what, what what)
Cos you keep on fadin' out 
You're not comin' through, whatcha gon' do? (what)
Whatcha talkin' bout, who you think you're fooling? (no, oh)
There's no way I'm hangin' out
With someone like you, whatcha gon' do?
Wish it be the same but I doubt that you could change
Cos you're caught up in your me, myself and I don't give a
Cos I know we're not the ones to blame
But we had it goin on till you started doin' us wrong
I'm not trying to be a hater but your words are stuck
I'm fed up and I had enough, oh-oh
Whatcha talkin' bout (oh oh)
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout (oh oh)
Whatcha talkin' bout
Tell me
Whatcha talkin' bout, I don't really hear it (what you talkin bout?)
Cos you keep on fadin' out (keep fadin' out)
You're not comin' through, whatcha gon' do? (come on, no)
Whatcha talkin' bout, who you think you're fooling?
(Uh, huh, who you think you're foolin?)
There's no way I'm hangin' out
With someone like you, whatcha gon' do?
(Like you, what you gon' do?)
Whatcha talkin' bout, I don't really hear it (what you talkin bout?)
Cos you keep on fadin' out (keep fadin out)
You're not comin' through, whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha talkin' bout, who you think you're fooling?
(What you talkin bout?)
There's no way I'm hangin' out
With someone like you, whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
(Repeat to Fade)
