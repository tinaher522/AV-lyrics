Yes, let's do it again
But just me and you this time
Cos I like the thug in you,
Yeah, give it up baby
No, don't call your friends
And I'll leave my girls too
Cos I like the thug in you, yeah, give it up baby (I need you to myself)
Baby it was cool and all that
Hangin' with our friends and holding back
Why we was feelin', the pressure had us wide open for sure
Funny watching you try and front
And playin' it off like you wasn't scheming
I read right through your every move, I just want you to know
Yes, let's do it again (na-huh)
But just me and you this time 
Cos I like the thug in you, yeah, give it up baby
No, don't call your friends (na-huh)
And I'll leave my girls too, 
Cos I like the thug in you, yeah, give it up baby (I need you to myself)
Boy I like the way you wear your hair
And the way them new come down, yes
And when you're driving to the side your profile turns me on
Even tho we sometimes scream and shout
You know what a good times all about
That's why I took your number, baby I want you, my word is for
I could rock, with you cos, you give me, such a buzz
And it's crazy how you make me feel, oh yeah
Just down to, me and you, anytime, it's up to you
Cos I'm ready, just tell me, you'd rather be by yourself
Yes, let's do it again (let's do it again)
But just me and you this time
Cos I like the thug in you, yeah, give it up baby
No, don't call your friends (na-huh)
And I'll leave my girls too
Cos I like the thug in you, yeah, give it up baby (I want you to myself)
There's so many things (so many things)
That me and you both could do (yeah yeah yeah)
I can't wait to get with you
I need you to make it soon, yeah (uh uh)
We did have fun (oh we did have fun)
Baby, laugh with everyone
But we both wanted to leave (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And be by ourselves indeed, yeah (oh yes)
