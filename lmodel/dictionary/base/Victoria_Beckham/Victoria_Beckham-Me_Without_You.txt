<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Me_Without_You">
I'm under your influence
And I see no pretence
In all that you do
You're all I've been waiting for
I can't help wanting more
Carry me through
Beautiful
Innocent
Caught me out
Unaware
Ooh, what in the world would I do
Can't think of me without you
What would I be without you baby
Ooh, what in the world would I do
Can't think of me without you
What would I be without you baby
I'm drifting I'm lost in love
Don't want to find myself
No-way
You got me I'm hypnotised
I hang on every word
That you say
Beautiful
Innocent
Caught me out
Unaware
Ooh, what in the world would I do
Can't think of me without you
What would I be without you baby
Ooh, what in the world would I do
Can't think of me without you
What would I be without you baby
Beautiful
Innocent
Caught me out
Unaware
Beautiful
innocent
captured me
I don't care...
Ooh, what in the world would I do
Can't think of me without you
What would I be without you baby
Ooh, what in the world would I do
Can't think of me without you
What would I be without you baby
