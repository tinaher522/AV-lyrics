<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="25_Minutes">
Ah-ah-ahh
Ah-ah-ahh
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Time goes slowly
Feeling lonely for you
Can't get you off my mind
Darkness falling
My hearts calling to you
Can't get you on the line
Nothing but frustration on this long and lonely ride
I can feel anticipation building up inside
25 minutes to go
I'm lost in the rain and I'm moving way too slow
To get to you
25 minutes to go
I can't find my way got the radio down low
Trying to talk to you
Brightlights blinding
Now I'm feeling that time
Is never on my side
Keep on moving
Never see the signs
I'm gonna lose my mind
Nothing but frustration on this long and lonely ride
I can feel anticipation building up inside
15 minutes to go
I'm lost in the rain and I'm moving way too slow
To get to you
15 minutes to go
I can't find my way got the radio down low
Trying to talk to you
Ah-ah-ahh
Ah-ah-ahh
Ooh-Ooh-Ooh
Nothing but frustration on this long and lonely ride
I can feel anticipation building up inside
12 more minutes to go
I'm lost in the rain and I'm moving way too slow
To get to you
5 more minutes to go
I'll never find my way got the radio down low
Trying to talk to you
1 more minute to go...
