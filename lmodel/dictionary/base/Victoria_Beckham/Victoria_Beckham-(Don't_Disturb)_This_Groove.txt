Hi, it's me
(Keep your eyes on me)
You wouldn't believe what I'm doin'
Well come on then
(Keep your eyes on me)
Well take a little bit
It feels good
(Keep your eyes on me)
What're you doing?
Come on, let me hear you (Oh)
You see I made the decision to give you a call
Cos sex is written in the scribble writings on the wall
Baby I've been going crazy sittin' in my room
Fantasizing about you has never felt so good
I can't take it no longer, ready to take it further
There's no time to talk it over boy you know I want ya
Can't you hear it in my voice the way I'm needing you
Here's your chance baby I'm ready if you're coming through
There's no limit baby boy you can have what I got
Get what you want, take what you see
I'm givin' you what you need
Whatever you want, just don't this disturb this groove
There's no limit baby boy you can have what I got
Get what you want, take what you see
I'm givin' you what you need
Whatever you want, just don't this disturb this groove
Why don't you check the reflection in my mirror frame
It's not the silver screen, it's serious, I'm not a game
I want you to come and listen to my body sing
Wanna hear my bell ring (biddy bong bing)
I've been waiting, my time is wasting, anticipating
The love of making all your dreams come true you're hesitating
Time is ticking better hurry up and follow through
All along so baby tell me what you wanna do
There's no limit baby boy you can have what I got
Get what you want, take what you see
I'm givin' you what you need
Whatever you want, just don't this disturb this groove
There's no limit baby boy you can have what I got
Get what you want, take what you see
I'm givin' you what you need
Whatever you want, just don't this disturb this groove
Don't say nothing (shh)
You wouldn't believe what I'm doin (shh)
Don't disturb this groove (shh)
Don't say nothin' (shh)
Keep your eyes on me
(Bing bong) I been waiting
(Bing bong) So keep your eyes on me
(Bing bong) Anticipating
(Bing bong) So keep your eyes on me
(Bing Bong) There's a sign up on the door
Saying don't disturb this groove
There's no limit baby boy you can have what I got
Get what you want, take what you see
I'm givin' you what you need
Whatever you want, just don't this disturb this groove
There's no limit baby boy you can have what I got
Get what you want, take what you see
I'm givin' you what you need
Whatever you want, just don't this disturb this groove
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
