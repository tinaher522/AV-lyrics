<song artist="Victoria_Beckham" title="Be_With_You">
Don't want nobody who don't satisfied
I spent a lifetime tonight
Of all the things I thought were right
Someone who don't need to fight
Maybe you feel what I feel it could be
Better than ever before
Trying to find what is meaning to me
Baby it's you I adore
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
I go to pieces everytime you're near
Without you I won't survive
You say the words I wanna hear
You know your love is so right
Over and over with you in my head
Feelings I cannot ignore
Finding a reason in things that you say
You in my life ever-more
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you
Wanna be with me
When the music plays
Take a chance on me
All the things you do
All the little signs
Wanna be with you
Wanna make you mine
Over and over with you in my head
Feelings I cannot ignore
Finding a reason in things that you say
You in my life ever-more
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
Cause I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Only wanna be with you (I only wanna be with you)
