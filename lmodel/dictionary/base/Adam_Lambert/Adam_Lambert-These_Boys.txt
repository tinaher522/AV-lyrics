Who you think you're calling stupid, stupid?
Mmm, well you think big, you trying to prove it? 
Prove it
Ohhh, you think really such a slick rick runner
Keep on talking you'll be a goner, yeah
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys, ya wanna have a go
Who you callin' clown?
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys 
When I'm gettin' close, so close
Well, I listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
So you think you quite a fighter? A fighter
Mmm, but you're looking more like a crier, crier
Ooh, bet you think you're really quite the stunner
But you're just like the rest, so go ahead and take a number, yeah
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys, ya wanna have a go?
Who you callin' clown?
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys
When I'm gettin' close, so close
Well, I listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
Slow me down, slow me down, oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Slow me down, slow me down oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Slow me down, slow me down, oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Slow me down, slow me down,
These boys can't slow me down
Take deep breaths
Try to take deep breaths
So I don't lose my composure
I see the edge
I can see the edge
When I feel I'm getting closer, closer
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys, ya wanna have a go?
Who you callin' clown?
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys
When I'm gettin' close, so close
Well, I listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go (listen to the, listen to the)
Listen to the radio then I let it go
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
Slow me down, slow me down, oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Slow me down, slow me down oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Slow me down, slow me down, oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Well, I listen to radio, then I let it go
These boys can't slow me down
