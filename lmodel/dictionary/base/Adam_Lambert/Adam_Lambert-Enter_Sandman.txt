<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Enter_Sandman">
Say your prayers little one
Don't forget my son to include everyone
I tuck you in, walk within
Keep you free from sin till the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light, enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight and they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire and of things that will bite, yeah
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light, enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land
Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet and in your head
Exit light, enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light, enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land
Yeah, ha, ha, ha, boom
Yeah, yeah, oh, whoa
We're off to never, never land
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land
We're off to never, never land
