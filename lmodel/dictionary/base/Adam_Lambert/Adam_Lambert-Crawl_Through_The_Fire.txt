<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Crawl_Through_The_Fire">
I can't find you in the smoke
The night is burning as we choke
Fire, fire, all around
Fire, fire, hit the ground
Get on the floor, souls to breathe
Get on the floor, souls to see
Fight the heat, crawl to me
Fire, fire erupts, fire, fire blowing up
Get on the floor, on your knees
Get on the floor, 'til they bleed
Crawl through the fire
Rescue and inspire
Crawl, make it through
Saving me, saving you
I can't find you in the smoke
The night is burning as we choke
Fire, fire erupts, fire, fire blowing up
Get on the floor, on your knees
Get on the floor, 'til they bleed
Fight the heat, crawl to me, yeah
Crawl through the fire
Rescue and inspire
Crawl, make it through
Saving me, saving you
Whoa, whoa
Fight the heat, crawl to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Crawl through the fire
Rescue and inspire
Crawl, make it through
Saving me, saving you
