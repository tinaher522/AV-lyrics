<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Slow_Ride">
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
I'm in the mood, yeah the rhythm is right
Move to the music, we can roll all night
Ooh, yeah, slow ride, ooh, yeah
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow down, go down
Got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, fold me, yeah
Slow ridin' baby, you're so fine
Slow down, go down
Got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me
Slow ridin' baby, you're so fine
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow down, go down
Slow down, go down
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride, take it easy
Slow ride
