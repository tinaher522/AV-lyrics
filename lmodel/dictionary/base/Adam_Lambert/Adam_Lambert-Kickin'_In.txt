<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Kickin'_In">
She wants to be up there
In the air where the clouds live
The sweetest seeds make the best trees
30,000 feet she can smile and now
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kickin' in?
Do you feel it Kickin' in?
Do you feel it Kickin' in?
Do you feel it Kickin' in?
Honey are you up there
Do you feel it Kickin' in?
Do you feel it Kickin' in?
Do you feel it Kickin' in?
Honey are you up there?
She wants to introduce me
To her friend Eddie
What is she tryin' to do to me?
He got words that rhyme
He got a dirty mind
Persuasive
Am I about to do a three? 
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kickin' in?
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Honey are you up there
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Honey are you up there
