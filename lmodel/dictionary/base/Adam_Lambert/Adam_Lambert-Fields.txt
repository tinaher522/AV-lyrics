<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Fields">
I don't know the reason
lets just make a choice
Lets throw out the caution
just one her voice
So walk me through
back through the fields
when i walked down
that road i find
i already know
On with the show
If there's a god
Then god only knows
Walk me back through
Fields i knew
So when
Like when we believed
a moment in time
When we shined
so walk me through
back through the fields
oh take me home
back to the fields
erase the dream
rewrite the scene
if there's a god,
then god only knows
what we should know
On with the show
Ohh, ooaahh,
ooaahh, oaah,
oaaaooahh, oaaooaahhoahh,
ooaahah, oooahh,
oaaah, oaaah,
oaahahhaa, oaaahhhh,
oaaaaahh, oaaahh,
oaaahhahhahh
