<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Born_To_Be_Wild">
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Yeah, darling gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under
Yeah, darling, gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature child we were born to be wild
We can fly so high, never gonna die
Born to be wild, born to be wild
Born to be wild, born to be wild
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Yeah, darling, gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature child we were born, born to be wild
We can fly so high, never gonna die
Born to be wild, born to be wild
Born to be wild, born to be wild
Born to be wild, wild, born to be wild
Explode into space, yeah
