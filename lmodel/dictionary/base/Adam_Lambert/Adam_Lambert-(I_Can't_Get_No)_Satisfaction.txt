<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="(I_Can't_Get_No)_Satisfaction">
i can't get no satisfaction,
i can't get no satisfaction,
but i try, and i try, and i try, and i try,
i can't get no, i can't get no,
when im drivin' in my car,
and the man comes on the radio,
hes tellin me more and more,
about some useless information,
supposed to drive my imagination,
i cant get no-a no, no, no, hey, hey, hey,
thats what i say,
i cant get no satisfaction, no,
i cant get no satisfaction, hey, hey,
and i try, and i try, and i try, try, try, try, try, try, yeah,
i cant get no, i cant get me no, i cant get no, no, no, no, hey-yay, thats what i say yeah ohh, oh, oh
