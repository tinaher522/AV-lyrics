<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Down_The_Rabbit_Hole">
Break out over-mechanical
Step right up to the freaky intangible
Hands uncuffed, take the leash on this animal
Hippies getting high fee, hit me with a night-c
Step right into your stripper shoes
Roll the dice, I got snake-eyes and déjà-vu
Popping off, fire melted with bally-hoo
Tune in, tune in, turn on, drop out
Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Quick, slow, high or low
You never gonna know for sho'
See in stereo
Down the rabbit hole
Catnip and honey
See it happen all over town
Houses are candy
Build 'em up and then burn 'em down
It melts in your face, not in your amour-all
It starts in the bass and it ends in the crystal ball, yeah
Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Disco rodeo
My kaleidoscope
Cleopatra knows
What's down the rabbit hole
Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on, follow
Come on and follow me
Quick, slow, high or low
You never gonna know for sho'
See in stereo
Down the rabbit hole
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
