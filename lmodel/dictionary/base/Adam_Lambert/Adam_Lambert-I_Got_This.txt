<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="I_Got_This">
Want some booty?
Take a number
Fling your fever at the camera
Bendy, Bendy, Bangy, Bangy,
Lose your mind on all my candy
I got this [I got this, I got this, I got this] x4
Dust in our eyes, dust that makes us cry.
Throw it on words and this love [x2]
Burnin, Churnin, Rolling Backwards
Swinging over, under, at last
Purple moons got us on fire
Wet and nasty's my desire
I got this [I got this, I got this, I got this] x4
Dust in our eyes, dust that makes us cry.
Throw it on words and this love 
Want some booty? 
Take a number
Fling your fever at the camera
Bendy, Bendy, Bangy, Bangy,
Lose your mind on all my candy
Burnin, Churnin, Rolling Backwards
Swinging over, under, at last
Setting sunlight acts so kindly
Sleeping Keeping acts so blindly
Dust in our eyes, dust that makes us cry.
Throw it on words and this love [x2]
