<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Loaded_Smile">
If I say I'm sorry, it's just me telling a lie
When you're in my arms, I feel emptier inside
I never felt so satisfied
Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
And, yeah, I know my life has changed
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive
A loaded smile
An empty glass
And one last dance
Walking hand in hand, you are all I ever want
And when you're not around, dear
Don't even notice that you're gone
We are barely hanging on
Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
And, yeah, I know my life has changed
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive
Makes me want you baby
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it?
If you still want to, baby
It's a certain kind of complicated
Makes me want you, yeah
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it?
If you still want to, baby
It's a certain kind of complicated
Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
And, yeah, I know my life has changed
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive
A loaded smile
An empty glass
And one last dance
