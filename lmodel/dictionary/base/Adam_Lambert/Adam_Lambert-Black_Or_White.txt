<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Black_Or_White">
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Oh yeah
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ahh
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them, I ain't second to none
And I told about equality and it's true,
Either you're wrong or you're right
Yeah
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Oh yeah
Ohh
Ohh, yeah
Yeah, ohh
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Oh, when the goin' gets mean
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
No, no
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
But, if you're thinkin' about my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
That's right, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh
