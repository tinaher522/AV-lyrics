<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Obsession">
It's early in the morning
And my heart is really moaning
Just thinkin bout you baby
Gots me twisted into things
And i don't know how to take it
But its driving me so crazy
I don't know if its right
Im tossin turning in my bed
Its 5 oclock in the morning
And i still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
Breathe ....i don't care
So helpless in my heart
I don't know what to do but to think of mi love
Baby...
Amor , no es amor (if this aint love)
More than my feelings (what am i doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Its just an illusion that i have in my heart
Now i know you know my lady I'm just tryin to make this right
I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if u let me could i getchu to say maybe we could ride together
We could do this all nite now i don't care if u got a man
Baby i wish ud understand
Cuz i kno he can't love u right, quite like i can
Its 5 oclock in the morning
And i still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
Breathe ....i don't care
So helpless in my heart
I don't kno what to do but to think of mi love
Amor no es amor (if this aint love)
More than my feelings (what am i doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Its just an illusion that i have in my heart
I like the way u freak it like that
I like the way u freak it like that
I like the way u freak it like that
Its an up for sho
Hold up let me drink
Shorty got me feelin less supreme
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got alot of money, i love this candy
And thats whats up and i don't care what people scream
No I'm blessin when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen
Im gonna keep it saucy
Cuz my money know how i do, we go rendevous to this song to you
Amor ...no es amor (if this aint love)
More than my feelings (what am i doing wrong) what am i do wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Its just an illusion that i have in my heart
Amor... no es amor (if this aint love)
More than my feelings (what am i doing wrong) what am i do so wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Its just an illusion that i have in my heart
Amor
