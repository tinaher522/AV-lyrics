<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Tribal_Segment">
I saw a picture of you
Hanging in an empty hallway
I heard a voice that I knew, and I couldn't walk away
It sent me back to the end of everything
I tasted all, I tasted all the tears
Again
Outside the rain's pouring down
There's not a drop that hits me
Scream at the sky but no sound
Is leavin' my lips
It's like I can't even feel
After the way you've touched me
I'm not asleep
But I'm not awake
After the way you loved me
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls that I can't break down
I said, I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut because of you
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
Let me outta this dream
Everywhere that I go, I see another memory
And all the places we used to know, they're always there to haunt me
I walk around and I feel so lost and lonely
You're everything that I want
But you don't want me
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls that I can't break down
I say I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut because of you
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
Let me outta of this dream
Dream
Let me outta of this dream
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls that I can't break down
I say I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut because of you
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
I'm a sleepwalker
Walker
Walker
Let me outta of this dream
