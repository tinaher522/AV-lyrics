<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Tracks_Of_My_Tears">
People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I make a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I am blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with somebody else
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although they might be cute there's just no substitute
'Cause you're the only permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile it looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
