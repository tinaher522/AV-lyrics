<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Play_That_Funky_Music">
Well, I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems burnin' down one night stands
And everythin' around me got to stop to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly, yes I did to disco down and check out the show
They were dancin', they were singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, till you die
I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish?
How could I to not see they were the one behind?
So still I kept on fightin'
Losing every step of the way
I said I must go back there, yes I will
And check to see if things still the same
They were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, till you die
Till you die, till you die
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die
