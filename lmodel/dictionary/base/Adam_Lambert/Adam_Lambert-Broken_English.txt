<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Broken_English">
Tower of babel has fallen down again
Information disarray
I don't know who i should believe in
Everybody's an authority
Fragments don't count
They always end up falling through the cracks
Don't think out loud
Cause once it's out your mouth, can't take it back
Can't say all the little things
That i wanna tell you right now
I know you won't understand
But i gotta tell you somehow
To us below i know
Now your body language is broken, broken english
Lost inside communication breakdown
Better just read my lips
