<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="After_Hours">
Gotta get out
Gotta get outside
I gotta get outside of my mind before I rip it out
I'm on a drive
I'm on a nightdrive
I gotta take a little trip, get twisted, and ride it out
Always after hours
I'm runnin' red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel
Always after hours
I'm burning red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel
I'm on drive
I'm on a nightdrive
I gotta take a little trip, get twisted, and ride it out
Always after hours
I'm runnin' red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel
Always after hours
I'm runnin' red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel
