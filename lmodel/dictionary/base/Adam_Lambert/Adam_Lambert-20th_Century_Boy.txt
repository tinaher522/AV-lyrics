<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="20th_Century_Boy">
Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Well I move like a rat
Talk like a cat
Sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see, you were meant for me
I'm your toy, your 20th Century Boy
[Chorus]
I said friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Yeah I well I move like a rat
Talk like a cat
Sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man.
And it's plain to see, you were meant for me
I'm your toy, your 20th Century Boy
20th Century Boy
I wanna be your toy
20th Century Boy
I wanna be your toy
Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Well I move like a rat
Talk like a cat
Sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see, you were meant for me
I'm your toy, your 20th Century Boy
20th Century Boy
I wanna be your toy
20th Century Boy
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
