<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="No_Boundaries">
Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait
Every moment lasts forever when you feel you’ve lost your way
What if my chances are already gone
Started believing that I could be wrong
But you give me one good reason
To fight and never walk away
So here I am — still holding on!
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain 
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down
I've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie
I've risked being safe but I always knew why
I always knew why
So here I am - still holding on!
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain 
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
You can go higher
You can go deeper
There are no boundaries
Above and beneath you
Break every rule cause there’s nothing between you and your dreams
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
Yeah
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain 
Weather the hurricanes
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
