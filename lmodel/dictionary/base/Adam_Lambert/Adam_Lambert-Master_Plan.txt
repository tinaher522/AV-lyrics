<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Master_Plan">
You run away from everything that you fear
So afraid ya don’t wanna be a part of it
You see the fake in everything that is real
You hate the paradox
You put us in a box
We gonna find out what makes us right or wrong
Waste of time – we just livin’ it
I wanna see you touch you one on one
No stoppin ’til we’re done
We’ve only just begun
We are the face of the new generation
We are the ones who have no reservations
Don’t give a damn ’bout your cold calculations
Welcome to the masterplan
Don’t care if you understand
Don’t care if you understand
Welcome to the masterplan
Your skin is burnin' at the sight of me
Your mask is hidin' what you’re thinkin’
Don’t ask (Don’t tell)
Just take what you need
I’m an open book
So why won’t you take a look
We are the face of the new generation
We are the ones who have no reservations
Don’t give a damn ’bout your cold calculations
Welcome to the masterplan
Don’t care if you understand
Don’t care if you understand
Welcome to the masterplan
There’s you… there’s me
I feel your energy
I hope we’ll see
Things ain’t what they used to be
Look at the face..
We are the face of the new generation
We are the ones who have no reservations
Don’t give a damn ’bout your cold calculations
Welcome to the masterplan
Don’t care if you understand
Don’t care if you understand
Welcome to the masterplan
Don’t care if you
Welcome to the masterplan
Don’t care if you
Understand
