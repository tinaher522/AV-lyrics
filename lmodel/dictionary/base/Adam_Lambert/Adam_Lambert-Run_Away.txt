<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Run_Away">
So high up, shouting,
Why can't everybody look
Deep inside for hope,
That'll make the world open up.
They don't want us,
Then they really don't want them.
They can hate us,
But we won't let that bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
Run away, we won't wear out our stay.
Run away, taking a holiday.
Run away, let's you and me parade.
Run away, then we can have our say.
Our lives matter so much more than what's in their minds,
I would rather disappear than live in fear.
If they don't want us
Then we really don't want them.
They can hate us,
But we won't let that bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
Run away, we won't wear out our stay.
Run away, taking a holiday.
Run away, let's you and me parade.
Run away, then we can have our say.
Just run away, uh-huh.
Just run away, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
Down to the ground.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
Run away, we won't wear out our stay.
Run away, taking a holiday.
Run away, let's you and me parade.
Run away, then we can have our say.
Run away, we won't wear out our stay.
Run away, taking a holiday.
Run away, let's you and me parade.
Run away, then we can have our say.
Run away, just run away.
Run away.
Run away, just run away.
Run away, then we can have our say.
Just run away, uh-huh.
Just run away, uh-huh.
Just run away, uh-huh.
Just run away, uh-huh.
