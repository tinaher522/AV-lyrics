<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Is_Anybody_Listenin?">
Father, can you hear me?"
-- "Your God hears you Joshua, and makes you a slave of the Pharaoh! Come on!"
They say I've got no right
to question life without hope
Or ask for anything more
than to suffer and bleed at the end of a rope
They say I've got no right
to look them in the eye
That I belong in the dust at their feet
but one day for sure, I'm gonna die
Is anybody listenin'?
Does anybody hear?
Does anybody out there
see us drowning in our tears?
Is our future written
on a sky of cold stone?
God, if you're listenin', let us know
God if you're listenin', let us know
They teach us to believe we're not strong like them
That we don't have the will
to crush these walls that hold us in
They try and make us think that we'll never have a chance
Can I fight for my own freedom
with only these two hands?
Is anybody listenin'?
Does anybody hear?
Does anybody out there
see us struggling with our fear?
Is our future written
on a sky of cold stone?
If you're listenin', let us know
God, if you're listenin', let us know
You can tie a rock to my soul
But you can't build a prison for my mind, no
You can chain my body
to the earth
But still the spirit flies
My spirit flies
Does anybody out there
see us drowning in our fear?
Will our hopes die slowly
in the heat of the desert sun?
God if you hear us
send us someone
God if you hear us
send someone
Is anybody listenin?
