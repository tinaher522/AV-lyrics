<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Wonderful">
So it would appear 
I left my heart here
And it would be fair to say
I've been swept away
So move in right along 
For you i wrote this song 
If i'm a fool
So this fool will never be with you
Oh yeh i know 
For just when i thought that we could make it
Realty strikes me down
For i dont want tomorrow 
Just give me some today 
I'll be on first train back home to yesterday
Yesterday
To yesterday
Leave me on the hell 
For 50 years
Dancing there
Leave me where you will
I'm very well
You are 
Wonderful 
Oh yes you are 
You are the star
Yes you are
Yes you are
You are the star
So keep well
And travel safe 
You are 
Wonderful
