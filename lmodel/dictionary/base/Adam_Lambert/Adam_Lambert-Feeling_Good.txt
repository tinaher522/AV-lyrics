<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Feeling_Good">
bird flying high
you know how i feeel
sun in the sky
you know how i feel
reeds drifting on by 
you know how i feel
its a new dawn
its a new day
its a new life 
for me..
and im feeling good
Fish in the sea
you know how i feel
river feeling free
you know how i feel
Blossom in the tree
you know how i feel
its a new dawn
its a new day
its a new lfe 
for me...
and im feeling good
dragonfly out in the sun
you what i mean
don't cha know
butterflies are havin' fun
you know what i mean
sleep in peace 
when the day is done
in this old world
theres a new word for me
and a bold world
for me...
yeahhh
stars when you shine
you know how i feel
scent of the pine
you know how i feel
freedom is a mine
you know how i feel
its a new dawn
its a new day
its a new life 
for me..
ohh for me..
for me
and im feeling, im feeeling, im feeling--- Gooood
feeling good
