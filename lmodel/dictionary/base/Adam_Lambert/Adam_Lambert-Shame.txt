<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Shame">
See, by now I would have learned just how you love to hurt me
Before I get a chance to speak you're convinced I'm guilty
God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys
But you're blaming me
You're blaming me
I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so,
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so (God knows you don't have to be so)
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window (I feel so thrown out the window)
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy
Now, I don't mind a little pain when I've really earned it, yeah
But you got me whipped and chained when I don't deserve it
God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys
But you're blaming me
You're blaming me
I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so (God knows you don't have to be so)
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window (I feel so thrown out the window)
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy
A shame, a shame
It's a damn shame
A shame, a shame
It's a damn shame
Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me ashamed
Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me ashamed
I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so,
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so (God knows you don't have to be so)
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window (I feel so thrown out the window)
You're too hard on your boy
I feel
Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me ashamed
Ashamed, ashamed
You've got me ashamed
