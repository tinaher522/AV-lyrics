<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Just_The_Way_It_Is">
I was going blind
Almost lost my mind
Letting go that we could share.
I'll love you always,
Connections like ours are not made to fade.
I thought I could find
Someone else to mind
Moving past these routine days.
I'll love you always,
Connections like ours are not made to fade.
Just the way it is.
Just a song now.
Just the way it is now.
Just the way it is.
Just a song now.
Just the way it is now.
I thought I could find
Someone else to mind
Moving past these routine days.
But I'll love you always, connections like ours
Are not made to fade.
Just the way it is.
Just a song now.
Just the way it is now.
You were the first,
Now I believe
Show me my thirst
You let me leave.
You had to grow
I had to go.
Baby, if we live just at night'
We know expectations.
Shining out a life
Was our degredation.
Just the way it is now.
I, I was going,
Mind, I almost lost my mind.
I let it go,
What we could share.
Loving you always,
Connections like ours are not meant to fade away.
