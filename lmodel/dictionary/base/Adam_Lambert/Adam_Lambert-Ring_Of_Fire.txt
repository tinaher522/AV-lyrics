<song artist="Adam_Lambert" title="Ring_Of_Fire">
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by the wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went up higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, and the fire went wild
I fell into burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went up higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by your wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames got higher
And it burns, ooh it burns
