<song artist="James_Bay" title="Wait_In_Line">
I can't shake this feeling
At the end o' each day
That I keep on working hard
But all I do is get payed
Though I keep believing
There's a light up ahead
'Cause it's only getting darker
And I could say in my bed
It's a fight
It takes so long
But I've learned to hold my own
So I stand
And I wait in line
With a heavy head
And this bottle of wine
And I watch
As they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
I walk home in the shadows
I carry me cage
And I hope they notice
What I brought to the stage
'Cause its a fight
And it takes so long
But I've learned to hold my own
So I stand
And I wait in line
With a heavy head
And this bottle of wine
And I watch
As they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
Ooh whenever it gets inside
It gets so hard to hide
Whenever it gets inside
Ooh I know you'll turn out right
Giving it all my life
I know you'll turn out right
And I stand
And I wait in line
With a heavy head
And this bottle of wine
And I vow
As they steal my time
I know one day I'll get mine
And I stand here and wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
