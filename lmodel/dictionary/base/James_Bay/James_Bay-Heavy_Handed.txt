<song artist="James_Bay" title="Heavy_Handed">
It's only getting harder
Talking to you without falling down
And this house keeps getting darker
We used to love, now all we do is shout
If we're cutting any corners
There's still a chance to make it right
So let's put our heads together
Before we lose our mind
Have I been holding on too strong?
Maybe I'm coming off all wrong
Is it our heavy handed love
Keeping us from moving on?
Feels like I'm treading the water
Trying to keep my head above the line
I hear the sound of you get softer
Lately you've been just so hard to find
And there's nothing I want more now
Than to say the perfect words
I try to make it better
But the trying only hurts
Have I been holding on too strong?
Maybe I'm coming off all wrong
Is it our heavy handed love
Keeping us from moving on?
