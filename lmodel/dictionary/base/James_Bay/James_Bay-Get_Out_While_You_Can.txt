<song artist="James_Bay" title="Get_Out_While_You_Can">
I've been working all night
Watching them empty out
Invisible to this crowd
Always double vision.
I've been losing my mind
Listening to broken speech
Stacking up broken seats
It's a lonely picture
And I hear your voice as it echoes round my head
Always that same thing that you said
Get out, get out while you still can
Don't let the night slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So, get out get out while you still can ooh ooh
As I'm sweeping up glass, I see the exit light so green
There's people falling into the street
Something comes together.
I've been here too long
And if I stay they'll tie me down
I know this chance won't hang around
So I'm gone forever.
And I hear your voice as it echoes round my head
Always that same thing that you said
So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the night slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So, get out get out while you still can ooh ooh
Packing up my suitcase, racing down forgotten street
Making my tracks along the cracks in the concrete
Seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
If you find me you will find me on the run.
For all the bleeding hearts pushing round their shopping carts
I have seen the greener grass; I have seen the faster cars
And I don't need your happy hours; I don't need your lonely bars
I'm ejecting like a bullet from a gun.
So take your final look at me, maybe even take my hand
Steady on the staircase come and chase the master plan
The long awaited getaway, play it like a grand slam
This is no encore, we have only just begun.
Get out, get out while you still can
Don't let the night slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (until the end)
