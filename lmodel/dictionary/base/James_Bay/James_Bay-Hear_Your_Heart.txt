<song artist="James_Bay" title="Hear_Your_Heart">
Between the streets, before the night
I found you all alone
Shaking tired, but looking lost
I came to take you home
And we're walk in silence
Side by side!
And I-I-I just wanna lay you down your burdens, all your fears
And I-I-I don't need your deepest secrets
Whisper in my ear
'Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
The wind is cold against
Outside is just a blur
I pull you close, you close your eyes
And we don't say a word
We've got to keep it ruling, ruling
And I-I-I just wanna lay you down your burdens, all your fears
And I-I-I don't need your deepest secrets
Whisper in my ear
'Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
And we walk in silence
Side by side!
And I-I-I just wanna lay you down your burdens, all your fears
And I-I-I don't need your deepest secrets
Whisper in my ear
'Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
