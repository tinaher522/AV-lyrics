<song artist="James_Bay" title="Best_Fake_Smile">
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh, if you don't like it.
She's working late and making eyes at the door
She's sick of everybody up on her floor
She wants the sun in her eyes but all she gets is ignored
She used to put it out and get it all back
But now she's slipping trying to carry the act
She's sweating under the lights, now shes beginning to crack.
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh, if you don't like it.
And you don't have to care, so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it.
No hesitation, now she gets up and walks
She thinks of all the pain and the pride that it cost,
She empties all the tip jars, it won't get back what she lost.
Outside the windows with two fingers to show
She lifts her head up just to blow out the smoke
She doesn't have to look back to know where she's got to go.
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh, if you don't like it.
And you don't have to care, so don't pretend,
Nobody need a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it.
If you don't bleed it, you don't need it anymore,
If you don't need it, get up and leave it on the floor,
No more believing
Like it's a voice you can't ignore
If you don't need it-you don't need it.
And you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Dont have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh
No, if you don't like it.
And you don't have to care, so don't pretend,
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh
Don't hide it.
And you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh
If you don't like it.
Oh oh oh
No, if you don't like it.
