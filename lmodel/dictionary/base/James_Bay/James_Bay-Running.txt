<song artist="James_Bay" title="Running">
When my heart is ready to burst,
When the world spins in reverse
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong
When you go, turn down the light
No one's here to hold you in the night
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home!
When our picture fades in the SUN
And all the colors blur in the one
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home!
When your all gets blinded
When you fold with the cards
No, I'll never stop fighting
To get to where you are!
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
When the lights are faded to black
Only stars are guiding me back
I'll keep running
To the place I belong
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home
