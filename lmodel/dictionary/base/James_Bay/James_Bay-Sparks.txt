<song artist="James_Bay" title="Sparks">
If I told you about my favourite dream
The one without you
Would you spit fire at me?
Or would you burn to know
Every single by blow
I don't know her
Maybe she isn't real
She didn't hold back
When you were lying next to me
This can't be all we are
Silent and in the dark
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight
Come a little closer
Remember when we used to sway
Trembling in the covers
Taking it with an only grey
This can't be all we are
Silent and in the dark
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight
No I never saw the walls
Falling on us like this
Now I'm hanging from a rope
Holding my hope, my hope
I don't need it, I just want it more than anything else
I can do this alone
No, no
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight
