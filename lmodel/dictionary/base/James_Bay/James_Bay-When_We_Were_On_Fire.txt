<song artist="James_Bay" title="When_We_Were_On_Fire">
Drifting apart, getting hard to hold you
Days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
Are we burning out?
Swept out of sight, rolling up on an ocean
Let's cut all the ropes and get lost in the moment
If our hearts are alive, maybe then we might
Send us back to the sun
Now I know, I know
That we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take-a-me back to where we was before
When we were on fire, fire
Head down, heading underground feeling wasted
Cold to the bone, so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up
Streets are alive now, and everything's bracing
You're on my mind, running in my veins fueling the flame
Let's start it again
And I know, I know
That we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take-a-me back to where we was before
When we were on fire, fire
We were on fire, fire
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa-oh-oh, now don't tell me no
That we're burning down
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa-oh-oh, now don't tell me no
That we're burning now
I know, I know we're losing light and our love is dying
Take me, take-a-me home
Back to where we was before when we were on fire, fire
And I know, I know that we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take-a-me back to where we was before when we were on fire, fire
When we were on fire, fire.
