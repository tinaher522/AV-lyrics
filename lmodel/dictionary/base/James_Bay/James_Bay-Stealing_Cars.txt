<song artist="James_Bay" title="Stealing_Cars">
All we need is a spark
A second chance, a lifeline
Waiting up in the dark
Holding up for a search light
No I don't know why seasons change
Or how we fell so far
Before our hearts go up in flames
Let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars
Let the heat of the sun
Reignite your memory
'Cause if we just turn and run
Let them fire the gun
No I don't know why seasons change
Or how we fell so far
Before our hearts go up in flames
Let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars
Sirens and smoke remind us
Maybe the world won't find us
Fall to the Earth in red light 'til it's gone
Gone
No I don't know why seasons change
How we get back to the start
Before our hearts go up in flames
Let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars
Let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars
Oh tonight these streets are ours to roam
Oh tonight these streets are ours to roam
