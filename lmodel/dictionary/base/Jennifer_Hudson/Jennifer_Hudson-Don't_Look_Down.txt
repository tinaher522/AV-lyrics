<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Don't_Look_Down">
You know that thing, that love thing
Make me wanna say
"Ooooh, look down"
It breaks my heart up every time
Then I think about what you told me that night
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No way I can escape what's in my mind
Oh, that's the way love goes
Love it takes you up, it takes you down, got you going all around.
Oh, that's the way our love goes
Open up your mind now don't be blind, I know baby you will find
There is no limit to how,
how we can go, if we don't look down
Don't live in the limits,
let's go higher and higher
Don't look down
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Baby nothing's broken, as it seems
Gotta find a way to let it flow (oh oh)
I know that there's a higher place to go
Oh that's the way love goes
Baby if it's real, then here's the biz, gotta accept it how it is
Oh, that's the way our love goes
Open up your mind now don't be blind, I know baby you will find
There is no limit to how,
how we can go, if we don't look down
Don't live in the limits,
let's go higher and higher
Don't look down
Oooh, see we cannot let go
And there's no looking down
When you walk on the side road
Gotta keep your eyes on the highest tracks of love
You don't have to worry
Don't you worry bout a thing
Just keep your eyes above
1, 2, 3 sing
There is no limit to how,
how we can go, if we don't look down
Don't live in the limits,
let's go higher and higher
Don't look down
There is no limit to how,
how we can go, if we don't look down
Don't live in the limits,
let's go higher and higher
I'm telling you don't look down
