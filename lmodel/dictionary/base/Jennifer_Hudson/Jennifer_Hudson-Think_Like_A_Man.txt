<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Think_Like_A_Man">
You gotta act like a woman
And think like a a man
Why you call me your dream babe
And foolish of me I believe that
You said every king needs his queen babe
That's why you needed me, baby
Right in between lust and love
You go and mess things up
Now there's no we, babe
There's just you and there's me, baby
There was us, there was trust
There was happen and change, I know
Silly you, silly me, silly us
What a waste
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
Now I'm gonna keep it realer with you, now than I ever been
Wish we would never been, girl, we was better friends
You didn't had to tell me what where, why and when
Ooh, I didn't need it 'cause you wasn't my girlfriend
We had a good thing, you would come by and kick it
Ooh give me that good thang, then after we was finished
You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever
Tell me what ever hell made us think this wanna gon' be better
And now I'm telling you lies all because I hate to see
The tears in your eyes, of course I want my cake and eat it too
I'm a guy and of course you don't understand
But you would if you thought like a man in love
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
Time cost money and it's so expensive
Versace, Lenny got these women blowing kisses
Leaning on my auto, she's so photogenic
Can I take a picture, she's my Mona Lisa
Living like a princess in a fairy tale
You know them people up in Barney, show and tell
Bentley backin' out of Neiman and I see no ponytail
5 karat yellow diamond, you don't know me well
Penthouse, set the drunks out on Collins Ave
She caught an atitude, I had to call a cab
You don't understand, it's altitude I'm balling at
I'm at the game on the wood, where the owners at
So different but the same, boy you taught me everything
Yeah, you show me how to think, you're the only one to blame
It's such a shame, yeah, should lost the game
You tell me how to play
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman but think like a man
But in love, in love, in love, in love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man
