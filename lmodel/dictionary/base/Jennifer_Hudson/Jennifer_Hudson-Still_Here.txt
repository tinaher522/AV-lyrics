<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Still_Here">
You looked at me and saw what I never could see
You made me be more than I thought I could ever be
And when I needed a friend you were always there to lift me up to make me strong
You're not gone your still here
With me all the time
You're still here
When I close my eyes
I still see you
I still feel you
And we'll never be apart
You're still here
Still here in my heart
In my heart
It's because of you I knew how it felt to be loved, Oh?
You made me feel beautiful cause you believed I was
And I will never forget how you touched my life
You made me feel like I belonged
You'll live on
You're still here
With me all the time
You're still here
When I close my eyes
I still see you
I still feel you
And we'll never be apart
You're still here
Still here in my heart
Oh?
You're my life
You'll be in my life
You'll be part of me
I'll just think of you and you'll be?
Still here
With me all the time, Oh Lord
Still here
When I close my eyes
I feel you
And we'll never never be apart
You're still here
Still here in my heart
In my heart
Still here
Aaahhhh
Still here
Oh?.
Whooo
Still here
