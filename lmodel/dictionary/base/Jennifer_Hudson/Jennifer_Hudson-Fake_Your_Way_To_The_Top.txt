[JAMES EARLY:]
Thirteen years of solid gold platters
Rising cost and cocktail chatter
Fat deejays, stereophonic sound
The game of hits goes 'round and around
But you can fake your way to the top
[CURTIS:]
'Round and around,
Try that part baby
[LORRELL:]
'Round and around!
[JAMES EARLY:]
Fake your way to the top
[DEENA:]
'Round and around!
[CURTIS: Spoken]
You fit right in there sweetheart!
[JAMES EARLY:]
You can fake your way to the top
[EFFIE:]
'Round and around!
[CURTIS: Spoken]
I knew you'd have it baby!
[JAMES EARLY:]
And it's always real, so real
[DREAMETTES:]
Always so real
[JAMES EARLY:]
Yeah, when you're comin' down!
[ANNOUNCER: Spoken]

Up, back up, back up
[DREAMETTES:]
All the way up...

[DREAMETTES:]
Doo, doot, doo doo
[JAMES EARLY:]

Workin' my way
[DREAMETTES:]

[JAMES EARLY:]
Through every town
I make my livin'
[DREAMETTES:]
Doo, doot, doo doo
[JAMES EARLY:]
Off of my sound
[DREAMETTES:]
Doo, doot, doo doo
[JAMES EARLY:]
And the game of hits
Here we go
Goes 'round, and around, and a

'Round and around and 'round and around
And 'round and around

Blow your horn!

Don'tcha know I made my way to the top

And it's always real, so real
