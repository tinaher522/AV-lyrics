(feat. Sharon Leal)
[Effie:]
Every man has his own special dream,
And that dream's just about to come true.
Life's not as bad it may seem,
If you open your eyes to what's in front of you.
[The Dreams:]
We're your Dreamgirls, boys,
We'll make you happy.
We're your Dreamgirls, boys,
We'll always care.
We're your Dreamgirls,
Dreamgirls will never leave you.
[Effie (Dreams):]
And all you got to do is Dream (All you got to do is Dream)
All you got to do is Dream (Just dream and baby)
[Dreams:]
Just Dream and baby we'll be there,
We'll be there,
We'll be there.
We'll be... there
