[Verse 1]
People always tell you
You gotta be careful way you walk
You gotta be careful how you talk
But trouble might come find you
And sayin' that we could never last
But I'm down to take a chance
'Cause you and me got a chemistry
That can't be denied I put you to stay with me
'Cause now I'm understand when I'm looking your eyes
[Chorus]
You just can't help who you love
Oh, no you can't help it
Not matter what you do
I'm kinda blind when it comes to you
Just can't help who you love
Oh, I'm totally helpless
For everything you do
I'm kinda blind when it comes to you
Just can't help who you love
[Verse 2]
We might as well just face it
Some folks that never gonna get
Why I chose you and no one else
'Cause you and me
We come from different worlds
Don't think you're good enough for me to be your girl
Baby stay with
'Cause now I understand
When I looking your eyes
[Chorus]
You just can't help who you love
Oh, no you can't help it
Not matter what you do
I'm kinda blind when it comes to you
You just can't help who you love
Oh, I'm totally helpless
For everything you do
I'm kinda blind when it comes to you
You just can't help who you love
[Verse 3]
Love can't be helped out
No way, no how
And they don't know babarus that people make up how
I wasn't expecting you to love me
The way that you do
Now you got me needing you
[Chorus]
You just can't help who you love
Oh, no you can't help it
Not matter what you do
I'm kinda blind when it comes to you
You just can't help who you love
Oh I'm totally helpless
For everything you do
I'm kinda blind when it comes to you
Just can't help who you love
Oh you can't help this
Oh, no you can't help it
You can't help who you love
I'm totally helpless
For everything you do
I'm kinda blind when it comes to you
Can't help who you love
