<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Bring_Back_The_Music">
Okay so here we go
Give me that
Just like that
Yeah let's start with some music
Give me a lil of something else
Let's take em, let's take em back
Won't you bring it back?
Will you bring it back?
Yeah we bring it back, yeah we bring it back
Singing together, dancing in the street
Music playing, moving to the beat ooh
Back in the time that music make me smiling
The song will change the weather, we can together
But some ever know the line we lost
I will make the music go out babe
Take away and enjoy, we start to fight
And before we lose this all on today
Won't you save? And bring it back? Say you bring it back
Gotta bring it back, gotta bring it back
Bring back the music, bring back the life
Bring back that feeling, feeling along
Let me talk to you
This sound of freedom, music makes me free
It makes you happy, gave you all you need
Back in the time he was ok with all
Music said the words you couldn't think off
But somewhere on the lines we own something
And we make the music go away
Took away enjoy and we start to fighting
And before we lose another today
Won't you save? And bring it back? Say you bring it back
Gotta bring it back, gotta bring it back
Bring back the music, bring back the life
Bring back that feeling, feeling along
Hey, bring back the music, bring back the music
Never let it go away
Hey, hey, hey bring it back
We need for music, we need for music won't you let the music play?
Hey, bring back the music, bring back the music
Never let it go away
Hey, hey, hey bring it back
We need for music, we need for music won't you let the music play?
