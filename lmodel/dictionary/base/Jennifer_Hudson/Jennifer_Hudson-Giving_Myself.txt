<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Giving_Myself">
I never been who I wanted to be 
I never felt completely free 
No ones ever had all of me 
Or made me feel so beautiful and sexy 
Now I'm flyin like an airplane 
Now I'm ridin on the open range 
Now I'm livin out my destiny 
I know the truth, 
I got it all in you and me 
Ohhhhhh..I'm giving myself over to you 
Body and soul 
I'm giving it over 
I'm giving myself over to you now 
Like a brand new day 
now you and I, we're the face of fame 
Ain't nobody got nothing to say, no 
And from my feelings 
I never have to run away 
No more 
Because he's here 
Holding me tight 
Now every day and night 
Oh baby 
Can't you see? 
I don't wanna be without you anymore 
Ohhhhhh..I'm giving myself over to you 
Body and soul 
I'm giving it over 
I'm giving myself over to you 
Ohhhhhh..I'm giving myself over to you 
Body and soul 
I'm giving it over 
I'm giving myself over to you 
For the first time 
I can stand in front of someone 
Finally 
I can be me 
I can just let my love spill over 
I can cry 
I don't have to lie 
I can finally let someone all the way inside 
All the way 
All they way 
All the wayyyyy 
Handing myself over to you 
Body and soul 
I'm giving it over 
I'm giving myself over to you 
I'm giving myself over to you 
Body and soul 
I'm giving it over 
And I'm giving myself over to you now 
[Plays in background] 
You know it's the right time 
I know it's the right night 
I know it's the right life 
I know you're the right man 
I know I'm the right girl 
Come on now feel it 
You feel it? 
I'm ready to give it over to youuuuuuuuuu 
I'm giving myself over to you 
Body and soul 
I'm giving it over 
And I'm giving myself over to you now 
All the way all the way 
I never love nobody else
