<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="What_You_Think">
You cannot possibly think that I'ma sit here and believe anything you tell me
What? you don't know by now that I'm smarter than you?
You know I'm just... like it is
Did you think that I was born yesterday?
Do you think if you told me that the sky was red I'd believe it?
Do you feel like I'm the... real...
Do you think if you made a long story, I would nodes
Cause you got another... hold off for you fix it up
You want to... your head, next to me think again
Sliding down the road before and I ain't going back no more
And if I'm wrong I apologize but if I'm right,
Before you lie to me, before you say anything
I know you thinking my mind is weak, boy I'm smarter than what you may think
Baby I'm not trying to be...
I just want this here to be heavy,
I don't want your love to get lazy
I know love ain't perfect but baby I'm so worth it
So give me everything and I'll give you my love in return
And I promise through this life of learn
We just keep each other first
And we can make it through... supposed
But baby if you trying to change your life
That's gonna be the end of that
And if I'm wrong I apologize but if I'm right,
Before you lie to me, before you say anything
I know you thinking my mind is weak, boy I'm smarter than what you may think
Before you say you're smart, know that I already heard
I know you thinking my mind is weak, boy I'm smarter than what you may think
Boy I suggest that you be honest, be honest, be honest
Boy I suggest that you be honest, be honest, be honest
Cause you can slick a can of oil boy
Don't let your mouth get you in trouble
So before you lie to me, before you say anything
I know you thinking my mind is weak, boy I'm smarter than what you may think
Before you say you're smart, know that I already heard
I know you thinking my mind is weak, boy I'm smarter than what you may think
So before you lie to me, before you say anything
I know you thinking my mind was weak, boy I'm smarter than what you may think
Before you say you're smart, know that I already heard
I know you thinking my mind is weak, boy I'm smarter than what you may think.
