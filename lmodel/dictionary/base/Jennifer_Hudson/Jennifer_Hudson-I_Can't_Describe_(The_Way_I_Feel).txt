<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="I_Can't_Describe_(The_Way_I_Feel)">
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I feel like I'm in love
That is nice but not good enough
I feel like saying something that's for us, that defines what's in our hearts
Dancing and we're playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)
This feels right, just staying up
And you don't describe when it's not
I can feel my heart be thumping from your touch
In my life you are my love
Dancing and we playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Or will I hide (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)
In the morning, hopefully you'll tell me why we're both yawning
But right now, think about it later, boy just love me now
Wait a minute now
Come on Shawty, you already know 'bout me
In the summer Barcelona, Monaco I be
Kickin' flave on the gold coast, doing the most
We poppin' gold bottles, twenty thousand toes
I'm sending beezy up, they can take a walk on the moon
My wife's got it showing in the middle of June
And we can kick it on the water when it's out in the street
On the yacht, so it' never free (getting money)
I'll let you get to play a card, if you play you're right
Make you shine on sight in the day or night
I could never be a bad I just say I be
But I could be good if the wood be good
In the drop top, park downtown, getting to it
Let you have it like a true dope boy should
The neighbors all here, you wanna do something to it
'Cause we work 'em all up, wake up to the mall up
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Dancing and we playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
