<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Feeling_Good">
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new day
And I'm feeling good
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, a new day
A new life for me
And I'm feeling good
Dragonflies out in the sun
You know what I mean
Don't you know
Butterflies having fun
That's what I mean
Sleep in peace until the day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
And I'm feeling good
Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of a pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, a new day
A new life for me
And I'm feeling good
It's a new day
I'm feeling good
It's a new day
I'm feeling good
