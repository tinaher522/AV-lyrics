[By The Four Tops]
I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
Well as far as I can see
You will always be
The one for me
Oh yes you will
And I believe
In dreams again
I believe
That love will never end
And like the river
Finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
Cause' I believe in you and me
I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
See I will always be around
Just to be right
Where you are
My love, you know I love you
I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside, can't you see
That I believe in you and me
Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I will play
The fool forever
Just to be
With you forever
I believe in miracles
And love's a miracle
Baby
You're my dream come true
I was lost, now I'm free
I believe in you and me
See I was lost now I'm free
'Cause I believe
In you and me
Believe in you and me
