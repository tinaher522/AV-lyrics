<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Spotlight">
Are you a man who loves, and cherishes, and cares for me?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Or are you a guard in a prison of maximum security?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Do we stay home all the time, cause you want me all to yourself?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Or am I locked away out of fear that I'll find someone else?
(Is that you? Is that you?)
Well I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
Is this a relationship fulfilling your needs, as well as mine?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you)
Or is this just my sentence, am I doing time?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you)
If this is love (real, real love), then I'm staying no doubt
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you)
But if I'm just love's prisoner, then I'm busting out!
(Is that you? Is that you?)
Baby I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
Oh, you oughta be ashamed of yourself!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Loving me, loving me so wrong
Baby all I do is try, to show you that you're my
One and only guy
No matter who may come along
Open your eyes cause baby I don't like...
Hey, cause I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
No I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
I don't like
