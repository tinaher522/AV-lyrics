<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="All_Dressed_In_Love">
When you can wear what you feel 
What do you wanna say? 
Now love is a little number that you can wear each day 
As long as you let me be the accessory 
Simply send me on my way 
'Cause I love love 
I look good in love 
When it's been out of sight and out of mind for such a long time 
That's how one forgets 
So I reached in the back of my closet, pulled it out 
And tried it on and it still fits 
Some cover their pain up with lots of MAC make-up 
But I can't help but blush 
Because I'm in love 
All dressed up in love 
(Chorus) 
Cool in the summer, warm in the winter 
I'm all dressed up in love 
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter 
Cuz I'm in love 
All dressed up in love 
People are looking, some people staring 
I don't know it, when they ask me what I'm wearing 
See this ole' thing, it's made for any weather 
My friend and I sit down and we both make it together 
Now if you really want one of your own 
I hope your shoes are made for walking 
Cuz I found love, and you must find love 
(Chorus) 
Cool in the summer, warm in the winter 
I'm dressed up in love 
I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter 
'Cuz I found love, 
And you must find love
