<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Heavy">
[Dreamgirls:]
Heavy, Heavy You got so heavy baby
Heavy, Heavy You got so heavy on me
[Beyonce:]
You used to be so light and free
You used to smile just looking at me
Now all you give is jealous hate
Come on daddy better lose some weight
[Dreamgirls:]
Heavy, Heavy You got so heavy baby
Heavy, Heavy You got so heavy on me
[Announcer:]
... present The Dreamgirls presenting their latest hit Heavy.
[Dreamgirls:]
Heavy, Heavy You got so heavy baby
Heavy, Heavy You got so heavy on me
[Beyonce:]
You used to want, nothing from me
You used to say let's both be free
You used to dance instead of walk
You never had to talk, talk, talk
[Beyonce:]
Heavy, Heavy (talk, talk, talk)
You got so heavy baby (talk, talk, talk)
Heavy, Heavy (talk, talk, talk)
Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, Heavy
