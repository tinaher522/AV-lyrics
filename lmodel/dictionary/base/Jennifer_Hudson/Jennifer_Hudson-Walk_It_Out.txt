<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Walk_It_Out">
You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a smile that money can't buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
Hey baby, hey, hey hey hey hey
I just moved in to town
I'm lost, can you show me the way, way, way
If I inconvenienced you
You can have me another way
Who me? Excuse me? mmm keep on working
If I didn't know no better
I'd think that you was flirting
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear, ear ear
Working on all 'em excuses to get up in here
And boy you talking good shit
And I swear that you could get it
I'm a good girl, I gotta think about my image
Would give it to you, but I'm sorry
I'm not just anybody
You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a something money can't buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
Hey baby, hey, hey, hey hey hey
Can we re-schedule, we can do this another day day day
Fuck it, let's do this today
I know you want to
Take me to your room
And I wanna go your way way way
But you gotta treat me like a lady
We should just get to know each other yeah
And the man will go all the way way way
But not on the first date yeah
You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a something money can't buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
I'll be on, I'll be on, I'll be, I'll be on that good shit
I'll be on, I'll be on, up that hood shit
You gotta take me out
Let me show you how
So approach me now
If you'll do it right you can turn me out
Slow it down
I'll give it to you now
Boy what you talking 'bout
If you wanna guilt me, you got a word for me
Now baby get at it
You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a something money can't buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
Walk it out
Walk it out
Yeah baby
Oh yeah
