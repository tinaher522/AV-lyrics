Effie:
And I am telling you 
I'm not going 
you're the best man I'll ever know 
There's no way I can ever go 
No, no, there's no way 
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you 
I'm not living without you 
I don't wanna be free 
I'm staying 
I'm staying 
And you, and you 
You're gonna love me, oohh ooh mm mm 
You're gonna love me 
And I am telling you 
I'm not going 
Even though the rough times are showing 
There's just no way, there's no way 
We're part of the same place 
We're part of the same time 
We both share the same blood 
We both have the same mind
And time and time, we've had so much to share and 
No, no, no, no, no, no 
I'm not waking up tomorrow morning and finding that there's nobody there 
Darling there's no way 
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you 
I'm not living without you 
You see there's just no way, there's no way 
Please don't go away from me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay, stay and hold me ahhhh yea
Stay, stay and hold me please
Stay and hold me, Mr. man
Try it, mister.
Try it, mister.
I know, I know, I know you can
Tear down the mountains 
Yell, scream, and shout like you can say what you want 
I'm not walking out 
Stop all the rivers, push, strike, and kill 
I'm not gonna leave you 
There's no way I will 
And I am telling you 
I'm not going 
You're the best man I'll ever know 
There's no way I can ever, ever go 
No, no, no, no way 
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you 
Oh, I'm not living without you, not living without you 
I don't wanna be free 
I'm staying, I'm staying 
And you, and you, and you 
You're gonna love me 
You're gonna love me, yes you are 
Ooh ooh love me, ooh ooh ooh love me 
Love me, love me, love me, love me 
You're gonna love me
