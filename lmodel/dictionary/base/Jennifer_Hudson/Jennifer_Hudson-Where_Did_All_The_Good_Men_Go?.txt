<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Where_Did_All_The_Good_Men_Go?">
Where did all the good men go?
Where did all the good men go?
Mmm, mmm, mmmm
Where did they go? 
Ha
Listen
5:46 in the morn 
She calls my phone 
Mm 
And she crying she says 
Jenni 
I can't take it 
No more once again 
I can't find Tyrone 
And I'm so sick of him 
Leaving me alone 
Why he just won't stay 
His tail at home 
And i all could do 
Is listen 
And hurt for her
And silently wonder 
Where did all the good men go? 
Where are the men that 
Still believe in honesty 
Respect and monogomy 
Where did all the good men go?
Now will somebody tell me 
Where did they go? 
Cause me and my girls 
Really want to know 
Line at the grocery store 
In isle 4, mm 
When i heard her say 
Baby, i wouldn't
Do no more 
And I heard somebody
Fall to the floor 
Crying she said u, said u 
Wouldn't hit me no more
And then security came 
Running through the door 
And i could do is listen 
And hurt for her 
And silently wonder (2x)
Why does it have to be 
So complicated 
When it comes to love
What God 
Created it beautiful 
Where is the good man 
Tell me 
Where is the man 
That wants me ohohoh
(Chorus)
