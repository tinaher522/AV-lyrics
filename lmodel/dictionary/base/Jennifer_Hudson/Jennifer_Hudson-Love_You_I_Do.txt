Effie:
Never met a man quite like you
Doin all you can, makin my dreams come true
You're strong and you're smart
You've taken my heart
And I'll give you the rest of me too
You're the perfect man for me
I love you I do
Mmm, I love ya
Never felt, quite like this
Good about myself
From my very first kiss
I'm here when you call
You've got it all
And confidence like I never knew
You're the perfect man for me 
I love you I do 
You've got a charm
You simply disarm me every time
As long as you drive
I'm along for the ride, your way,
I said it before,
There won't be a door that's closed to us
I'm puttin all my trust in you
Cause you, you'll always be true
I...I never could have known 
This would be
Ahhh, you and you alone, yeah
All for me.
I know you're the best, you've past every test
It's almost too good to be true.
You're the perfect man for me, I love you I do.
You're the perfect man for me, I love you I dooooooooooooooo!!!!!
