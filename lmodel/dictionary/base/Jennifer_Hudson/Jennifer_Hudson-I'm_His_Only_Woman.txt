[Jennifer Hudson:]
Hello
[Fantasia:]
Hello, Can I speak to Jennifer please?
[Jennifer Hudson:]
Yes this is Jennifer, may I ask who calling?
[Fantasia:]
Hi Jennifer, I'm Tony's girlfriend, I don't mean to call and disrespect you're...
[Jennifer Hudson:]
Wait a minute, Tony's girlfriend. Apparently you got the wrong number because I'm Tony's woman, his only woman that is.
[Fantasia:]
Well obviously that's what he's been telling you but I'm calling to introduce myself. My name is Fantasia.
[Jennifer Hudson:]
Did you just say introduce yourself
[Fantasia:]
Yea
[Jennifer Hudson:]
Well, I don't need no introduction. I am his woman and I am Jennifer Hudson.
If this was 10 years ago, I'd be at your front door, ready to whoop yo' ass. But you know what; I'm to grown for that. I ain't got nothing else to say.
[Jennifer Hudson:]
I'm his only woman (his woman)
And you can't break up this home
You can say what you want
This is my man get your own
After all these years I spent
Must've been close to 10
You can't mean the same to him
Especially when that's my man
[Fantasia:]
Baby now that he's with you
Tell me why he call me boo
Yes he played you like a fool
Cause he lying to you
I'm just trying to talk to you baby
Woman to woman
Like to adults
Not trying to start commotion
But the man you claim is yours
Says he's mine and he loves me too
Same promises to you
The honest truth, yes we've all been fooled
[Jennifer Hudson:]
Seems that you're the one,
Who's calling me!
Oh, he belongs to me
And only me
And only me
This situation,
You don't want no confrontation
With, with me boo
I don't know what he's telling you
But it seems to me that your confuse
[Fantasia:]
I'm his only woman, his woman
And what you saying to me
I don't care
[Jennifer Hudson:]
I'm not trying to go back &amp; forth
Simply you're not welcome over here
After all these years I spent
Must've been close to 10
You can't mean the same to him
Especially when that's my man
[Fantasia:]
Baby now that he's with you
Tell me why he call me boo
Cause he lying to you
[Jennifer Hudson:]
I can't believe it
The same man I knew when he lived with his momma
[Fantasia:]
I knew him to, yea
[Jennifer Hudson:]
The same damn man
Who care note that I paid
Who bed that I made
So you better believe
After all the years I spent
Must've been close to 10
You can't mean the same to him
Especially when he's my man
[Fantasia:]
Baby now that he's with you
Tell me why he call my boo
Yes he lied to me
[Both:]
And he's lying to you
