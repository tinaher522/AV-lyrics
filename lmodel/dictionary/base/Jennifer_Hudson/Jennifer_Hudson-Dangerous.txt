<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Dangerous">
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Touch my body
You make me feel like I'm alive
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Dangerous, like, like no hands on a motorbike
Riding at the speed of light
When I'm with you ride like never seen street fights
I got you, you got me right
Like there ain't no daddy do, do or die
Turn my name so I know you're mine
Daddy you know that I die for you, die for you
Daddy do, do or die,
Stay with me 'till end of time
Daddy you know that I die for you, ride for you
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Touch my body
You make me feel like I'm alive
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Dangerous, yeah, yeah, think I'm riding from cloud 9
Even if I we get caught now, anything for you
Yeah, yeah, hold my body out for ransom
'Cause I wanna get hands on, hands on
Yeah I wanna get my hands on
Daddy do, do or die,
Turn my name so I know you're mine
Daddy you know that I die for you, die for you
Daddy do, do or die,
Stay with me 'till end of time
Daddy you know that I die for you, ride for you
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Oh, give me light
Make me feel alive
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Touch my body
You make me feel like I'm alive
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
