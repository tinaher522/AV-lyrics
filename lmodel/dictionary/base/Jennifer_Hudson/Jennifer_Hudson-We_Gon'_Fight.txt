Hands up
If you with me, put your hands up
Hands up
Wait a minute, wait a minute ya'll
They told me that love was simply not enough
With all that we been through
We should give it up
Why sweat and cry
Just leave and make it easy
I told em' it would hurt me worst
But they just don't believe me
Been locked up, bailed out
Broke, overdrawn
Staying at my momma's house
Ya'll don't know what I'm talking bout
Like gangsta's we gone strap up for this war
And I'd die for mine
Cause you're worth fighting for
Can't nobody tell me bout this here (oh no)
Now let me make it clear (I won't)
Let ever thing we've done in the name of us (us)
Done in the name of love (love)
Be nothing
So I'm a fight for you
You gone fight for me
I'm a fight for you
That's how it's gone be
We gon fight
Why trip on conversations bout our past
Like we didn't make it
Like we didn't man up and take it
Straight up and with you
We go back like... and
I know I'm crazy
That's how you made me
Been locked up, bailed out
Broke, overdrawn
Staying at my momma's house
Ya'll don't know what I'm talking bout
Like gangsta's we gone strap up for this war
Cause I'd die for mine
Cause you're worth fighting for
Can't nobody tell me bout this here (oh no)
Now let me make it clear (I won't)
Let ever thing we've done in the name of us(us)
Done in the name of love (love)
Be nothing
So I'm gone fight for you
And you gone fight for me
I'm gone fight for you
That's how it's gone be
We gone fight
Fight because we should
On every things that's good
I can't leave
(We've come to far to turn back)
And to the haters that we shook
Giving us dirty looks
Watch and see
(No matter what goes),
No matter what stays),
Ain't gone late nobody tear us down
We going all twelve rounds
Let's put em up (no)
No giving up (we)
We gone make it just because
Because we gone fight for love
Can't nobody tell me bout this here (oh no)
Now let me make it clear (I won't)
Let ever thing we've done in the name of us(us)
Done in the name of love (love)
Be nothing
So I'm gone fight for you
And you gone fight for me
I'm gone fight for you
I'm Gone Fight
That's how it's gone be
We gone fight
We gone fight
Holla if you hear me
We gon fight
This thing is getting rid of me
We gon fight
Put ya hands up if you feel me
We gon fight
