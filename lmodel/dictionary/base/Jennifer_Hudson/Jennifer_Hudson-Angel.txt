<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Angel">
We can touch the sky...
I was never looking 'round
Trying to find someone
That'd like to tie the knot
Little did I know
I was in need
To find the one that made me feel so heavenly
There's no way that I'm
Ever goin' back again
Heaven's in your arms
Got me until the end
Let me be your angel
To the golden door I'd do come running
When you need someone
I'll be your angel
When you wanna fly I'do come running
And we can touch sky
We can touch the sky...
Some people, will never see
How you came into my life
And set me free
But little do they know
That I've been found
Flying so high, so high above the ground
There's no way that I'm
Ever goin' back again
Heaven's in your arms
Got me until the end
Let me be your angel
To the golden door I'd do, come running
When you need someone
I'll be your angel
When you wanna fly I'd do, come running
And we can touch sky
Let me be the lady in your life
Let me be the one that has your flight
Let me be that angel love that you've been looking for
Let me take your feet up off the ground
Let me promise you'll never come down
Let me be the lady that you cherish and adore
Let me be your angel
To the golden door I'd do, come running
When you need someone
I'll be your angel
When you wanna fly I'd do, come running
And we can touch sky
