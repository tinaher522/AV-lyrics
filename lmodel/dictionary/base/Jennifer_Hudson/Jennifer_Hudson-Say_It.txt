<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Say_It">
I've been playing the fool for too long
Giving the power of my love on dawn
Watching you all dy long, watching you
And I can't take no more
Baby I like it, baby I love you and I gotta know
Do you need me baby?
Then tell me what should I do?
(Tell me you love me too, tell me you love me too
Tell me you need me too, tell me you need my love)
Say you need y love
(Said I only want you)
Say I only want you
If you love me say yes, say yes, say yes
If you need me say yes, say yes, say yes
If you want me say it, say it
If you need me say yes, let me hear you say yes
You know I give you balls the? on my back
Pay to God to give you the faith that you like
Maybe I stay down, maybe I stay, maybe I got go
Maybe I love you, bbay I love you and I gottta know
Do you want me baby
Do you need me baby
Tell me I love you too
Tell me I love you too
And that you need me too
Tell me you need me too, tell me you need my love
Said you need my love, say I only need you
Say I only want you, if you love me say it
Say yes, say yes, say it
If you need me say it, say it, say yes it
Say it, say it, say it
If you need me say it, say it, say it
Let me hear you say
Come on girl, baby we could be in love
We can had each other but? can be enough
Tell me I love you too
Tell me I love you too
Tell me you need me too
Tell me you need me too
Tell me you need my love
Say you need my love
Say I only want you
Say I only want you
Tell me I want you too
Tell me I love you too
Tell me you need me too
Tell me you need me too
Tell me you need my love, tell you need my love
Say I only want you
Say I only want you
If you love me say it, say it
If you need me say it, say it
