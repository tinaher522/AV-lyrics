[C.C.:]
Effie, It's Been All These Years
You Havent Even Said, "Hello."
I'm Your Brother, Effie,
Say, "Hello."
Come On, Effie, You Know I'm Sorry
I Should Have Come Before Today
Hold Me Is All I Have To Say
[Effie:]
You've Always Been The Baby
[C.C.:]
But I'm Trying To Change
[Effie:]
And So Am I
[Both:]
It's Taken All These Years To Be Free
[Effie:]
Of Loving That Man
[C.C.:]
Finding Myself
[Both:]
And Getting A Hold Of The Anger In Me
[C.C.:]
Effie, I Have A Song
And Only You Can Sing It The Way It Should Be
[Effie:]
I've Waited So Long To Hear You Say That To Me
Say It Again! Say It Again!
[C.C.:]
Effie, Sing My Song The Way It Should Be!
