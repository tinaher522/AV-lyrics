<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Stand_Up">
Said I, I, I
I never meant to hurt you
But you didn't even try
To take away my pain
Or dry my weeping eyes
Cause you can't
Can you baby?
Keep doing me wrong
And I won't accept it no more
You had me so caught up baby
Had me so blind
Everything was about you
I put all my needs aside
So go back to her
Stop wasting my time
Cause I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna stand up
(Stand up)
I'm tired of being let down
Takes a damn fool
To keep you around
Gonna stand up
On my two feet
Cause I don't need you
To make me complete
See, I had to learn the hard way

That you were doing me
You were doing me wrong
I'ma stand up
You left me alone
And gave me the power to finally stand up
(Stand up, damn fool)
To keep you around gonna
Stand up
On my two feet
Cause I don't need you to make me complete
To all my ladies and my girls
Know that he's not your world
Don't be afraid to leave
Come on ladies sing with me
And stand up (Stand up, damn fool)
I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna
Stand up
On my two feet
Cause I don't need you (I don't need you)
To make me complete (I won't need you)
Stand up (I won't miss you around oh baby)
(Damn fool) I'd be a damn fool to keep you around
Stand up
(I'll stand up)
I don't need you to make me complete
