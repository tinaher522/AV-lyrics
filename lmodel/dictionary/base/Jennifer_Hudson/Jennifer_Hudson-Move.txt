Move, move!
Move right out of my life!
Move, move!
Move right out of my life!
[EFFIE WHITE (LORRELL ROBINSON AND DEENA JONES):]
You better move (Move!)
You're steppin' on my heart
I said move (Move)
You're tearing it apart, please move! (Please move)
Ohhh, what am I gonna do, my heart (My heart)
Ooh, breaking breaking up over you (Breaking, breaking up over you!)
You've got such magnetic power
That just keeps holding me down (Oooh)
I feel just like a flower
That you keep stomping the ground
[DREAMETTES:] Move, move!
Move right out of my life!
Move it, move it!
Out of my life!
Move, move!
Move right out of my life!
Move it, move it!
Out of my life!
Move, move!
Move right out of my life!
[EFFIE WHITE (LORRELL ROBINSON AND DEENA JONES):]
You are so horribly Satanic
The way you lead me around (Oooh)
I feel just like the Titanic (Ohhhhh)
I'm always going down, down, down, down!
(Move, move, you're steppin' on my style)
You're steppin' on my style!
(Move, move, I wanna breathe for a while)
Ohh, please move, I wanna breathe for a while
(Move, move, move right outta my life)
Ohh, baby!
(Move it, move it, outta my life)
Ohh, baby!
(Move, move, move right outta my life)
Get outta my life!
(Move it, move it, outta my life)
There's too much pain and strife
So why don't you pack it up and move it, (Move)
Take the cat, kit, and caboodle (Move)
Your broken down car (Move)
Your old smelly cigar (Move)
And just move right outta my (Move, move, move)
Move right outta my life! (Move right outta my life!)
