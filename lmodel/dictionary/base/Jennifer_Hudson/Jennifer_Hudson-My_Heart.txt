Whoa Whoa 1234
What's up girl? let me holler at you for a second.
I just want you to know all of those other girls
They never meant anything to me, your the only one for me
[Verse 1:]
You turned me on, sounds so good talking fast.
But before we go on there's something I must ask,
not about your past cause I don't care who came before me,
no my mauturity is bigger than that.
I am more curious bout what you truely want,
do I since sencerity or just good talk,
I don't care bout the rumor mill
but be understanding how you truely feel for me,
and yea I want you sexually
[Chorus:]
But I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking bout them,
(Ain't talking bout her) ain't talking bout him
(I'm talking bout trust) I'm talking bout truth
(I'm talking bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) please take care
(This is my heart)always be there
(This is my heart) something you can't take
So whatever you do please don't break my heart
[Verse 2:]
Some girls are satisfied with clashing heads
And some girls are happy just to have a man
But my heart has my word to never put her in the way of harm
So you know I like your charm
[Chorus:]
But I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking bout them,
(ain't talking bout her) ain't talking bout him
(I'm talking bout trust) I'm talking bout truth
(I'm talking bout me) and what I'm giving you
(this is my heart) so treat it like gold
(this is my heart) pretend that it's yours
(this is my heart) it's too valuable to loose
So whatever you do please don't loose my heart
[Bridge:]
One night asint gone get you no where,
there's so much to learn
and what you dedicate to me is what you'll get back in return,
now my bedroom game is sick,
and that's only the half of it, (I need love),
I'm tired of the same, (give love)and no games
[Chorus:]
But I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking bout them,
(Ain't talking bout her) ain't talking bout him
(I'm talking bout trust) I'm talking bout truth
(I'm talking bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) so ebfore you lie
(This is my heart)draw me a line
(This is my heart) pain shows up
So whatever you do please don't break my heart
My heart
I'm talking about the truth, and what I'm giving you
This is my heart
