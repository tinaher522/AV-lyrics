<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Where_You_At">
You said when the storm came
That you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain
And you said you’d protect me
From heartache, pain, lies, loneliness, and misery
You said you’d tear down the walls that were in my way
You promised things would be okay
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for you, but you never showed
Where you at? Oh, where you at? Oh,where you at?
Boy you say would be here for me
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Now you said you go to church
Stop slanging, find a real job, and go to work
And you say you stay out of the streets
And spend more time with me
Take away my doubts and fears and fulfill my dreams
You said you’d be that shoulder for my eyes to cry on
Said you would be that one that I could depend on
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for you, but you never showed
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at?
Boy you say would be here for me
Where you at? (Where)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
And oh false promises is much like fake named
You painted a picture for me but there was no frame
You made my future look bright and I believed every word
I went to sleep on the clouds and woke up in the dirt
And now I’m without shelter and the wind is blowing
You say you’d be there for me boy when the tough got going
Said if weapons draw, you’d stand in front of me
Whenever I fell trapped, said you’d be the one to set me free
Thought you were my hero
But as it turns out you a no show
Tell me where
Where you at? ( you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at babe?)
Where you at?
Oh you said would be there for me
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Baby where you at?)
Where you at?
You said you’d be right there for me
Where you at? (And i cant)
Where you at? (See)
Where you at? (See, See)
Where you at? (See)
Where you at?
You’d said you’d be right there for me
