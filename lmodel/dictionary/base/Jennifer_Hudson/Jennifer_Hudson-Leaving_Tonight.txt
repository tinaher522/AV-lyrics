Song: Leavin' Tonight aka Leaving Tonight
Artist: Ne-Yo, Jennifer Hudson
Written By: (Shaffer Smith &amp; Co.)
Album: Because of You (Know Me draft)
(Spoken)
I believe that love &amp; trust are one in the same/
I don't think you can truly love someone unless you trust them/
That blind trust, beyond a shadow of a doubt/
No matter what this person say or that person/
You believe your man/
Now you say you love me/
But everytime one of your little friends come at you with something/we gotta to this.
Momma I'm trying (I'm trying)/
To show you that I'm for real/
Tell me what I gotta do to show you I'm for you/
Jennifer Hudson - Spoken:
Just shut up and listen/
Verse 1 - Jennifer:
Two hundred and sixteen/
Thats how many times that I went back and forth about it/
In my mind /Could she (could she) really be, who he's telling me that she is/
That's something about it that don't feel right/
Saturday she called here twenty six times/
Ne-Yo: (Oh you counted?)
You kept telling me not to worry/
Ne-Yo: (Don't worry about it)
Wanna believe that your telling the truth/
Ne-Yo: (So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me/
Chorus:
You're leaving tonight/ outta my life/
Everyone said you ain't no good/ And you proved them right/
Leavin' Tonight / It's over and done /
Ain't no sense and trying to / wait til the morning comes/
(Leavin' Tonight)
Verse 2:
Baby now hold up/ Lets just settle down/
Cus there's a perfect explanation/ To this situation/
That were going through/ (this thing that were goin through)/
I swear that I dont know that girl/ But I seen her around/
And she has expressed how much she want it./
But baby i'm knowing that/ all of me is for all of you /
Said I gotta call like a thousand times/
JHud: (Oh so you counted?)
She kept telling me not to worry/
JHud: (Don't worry about it)
Please beleive I'm telling the truth/
JHud: (I wouldnt doubt it)
I really wish you would beleive in me/
Chorus:
I'm not leavin' tonight/ Girl your my life
All of your friends think i'm no good/ Please don't prove em right/
I'm not leavin tonight/ It's over and done/
Lets leave this alone/ And lets make love til the morning comes/
Not leaving tonight/

Bridge: (Jennifer Hudson)
Oh I wont deny that everything in my body wants to know that you're the one
Ne-Yo: (Then whats the problem girl?)
See I cant take this serious, when your just having fun
Ne-Yo: (Oh I'm not just having fun)
Steady running around
Ne-Yo: (I'm not running around)
Making fool of me
Ne-Yo: (Baby girl you can't listen to everyone)
Bridge - NeYo
I'm your man
JHud: (Your the man)
Trust in me
JHud: (uh huh)
Don' let them interfere with us being happy
JHud:(Babe)
Love me girl
Verse 3: (JHud)
I love you/ thats a fact
Ne-Yo: (Say that you love me babe)
But I'll be damned /If Imma let you up and disrespect whose been there from the start / not gon disrespect my heart/
You claim (you claim) to not know her (not know that girl)/
But name and number is in your phone (she even got a ringtone)/
You care to explain that part?/
Bridge: (Pre-Chorus): (Jennifer) 
Saturday she called here twenty six times
Ne-Yo: (I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry about it.
Ne-Yo: (Please don't worry about it)
Wanna believe you're telling the truth.
(So don't doubt it.)
But if you are lying to me.
Ne-Yo: Im not leaving tonight
