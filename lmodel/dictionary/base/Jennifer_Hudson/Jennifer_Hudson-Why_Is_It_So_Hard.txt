<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Why_Is_It_So_Hard">
Well I'm on the fence, I'm undecided
So very tense still a little upset
But I don't wanna make an angry decision
And regret it late, so I haven't decided, yeah
But I could never ever feel like this
When the words "I love you" leave my lips
I mean it when I say I just hate how difficult you make it
Why is this so hard? So hard? So hard to love you
So hard to stay, hey
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, no
Cause it makes sense irration to me,
I'm still around though I can't believe one word that you say
No it don't make no sense, I'm always crying
But I'd cry oceans if you ever went away
But I could never ever feel like this
When the words "I love you" leave my lips
I mean it when I say I just hate how difficult you make it
Why is this so hard? So hard? So hard to love you
So hard to stay, hey
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, no
Why is this so hard? Oh I can walk out that door
And never come around anymore
But that would make no sense to me
See I love you baby, and through the thick and thin
This is where I'm supposed to be, supposed to be
Hey, why is this so hard? So hard? So hard to love you
So hard to stay, hey
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, no
Why is this so hard? So hard? So hard to love you
So hard to stay, hey
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, hey,
Why is it so hard?
