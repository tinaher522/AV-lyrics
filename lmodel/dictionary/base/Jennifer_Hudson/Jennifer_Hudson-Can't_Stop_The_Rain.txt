Oooooh oooh ooh [x2]
27th of january, think he died a year ago today
She's crying on my shoulder and begging me to make the hurting go away
Pretty brown eyes, tears full of guilt, a heart full of pain and fear
I wanna tell her it's okay but we both know she's the reason he's not here.
I keep on crying, but it doesn't seem to help at all {seem to help at all}
With every single tear drop, it's like another raindrop falls
And I would {and I would}, if I could {if I could}... but the try would be in vain {the try would be in vain}
Said so matter what I do... I can't stop the rain.
So I cry
Oooooooh... I can't stop the rain {stop the rain} [x2]
If I could, you know I would... but the try would be in vain.
So I cry
Oooooooh... I can't stop the rain {stop the rain}
Faded picture in a little gold locket, and she never takes it off
I know it's small, but it's heavy 'cus it's filled with guilt
I know and she why his life is lost
I feel bad for her, but I'm having mixed emotions
'cus he was a friend of mine
Somewhere in the deepest darkest part of my mind
I wish it was her that died that night
{Ooooh}
I keep on crying, but it doesn't seem to help at all {seem to help at all}
With every single tear drop, it's like another raindrop falls {raindrop falls}
And I would {and I would}, if I could {if I could}... but the try would be in vain {the try would be in vain}
Said so matter what I do... I can't stop the rain
So I cry
Oooooooh... I can't stop the rain {stop the rain} [x2]
If I could, you know I would... but the try would be in vain.
So I cry
Oooooooh... I can't stop the rain {stop the rain}
One rainy saturday night, a happy anniversary
Celebrating long{? }, champagne all around
They had a little too much to drink
They got in the car, and he could barely stand up
So she figured that she'd drive.
Staring at him I suppose, a sudden jerk of the wheel,
And the car flipped about three times
{Oooooooh}
I keep on crying, but it doesn't seem to help at all.
With every single tear drop, it's like another raindrop falls {raindrop falls}.
And I would {and I would}, if I could {if I could}... but the try would be in vain.
Said so matter what I do {what I do}... I can't stop the rain.
So I cry
Oooooooh... I can't stop the rain {stop the rain} [x2]
If I could, you know I would... but the try would be in vain.
Oooooooh... I can't stop the rain {stop the rain}
