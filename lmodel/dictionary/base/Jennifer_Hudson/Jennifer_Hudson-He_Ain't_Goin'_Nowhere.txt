<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="He_Ain't_Goin'_Nowhere">
You should listen to the
Your boyfriend say
Search high and lows at his dirty mind
The concentrate on again his heartbreak
Find your treasure, make it last forever
Now
Give thought you want in more pleasure
Leave no one, y'all come together
Whisper in his ear
It makes it hotter
Don't like the sweat
It makes it better
That he'll come brand new ones
Don't hit him the question
I smile off the dust
Trust me girl don't stress him
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
Give thought you want in more pleasure
Leave no one, y'all come together
Whisper in his ear
It makes it hotter
Don't like the sweat
It makes it better
That he'll come brand new ones
Don't hit him the question
I smile off the dust
Trust me girl don't stress him
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
He ain't moving
He ain't going nowhere
