<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="No_One_Gonna_Love_You">
I, I, I, I've been through some things, please don't hold that against me;
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you,
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you....
Even though I, I, I still can feel the sting, no need to second guess me;
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you...
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you...
See, I, I-I-I-I don't mind you putting up a little bit of fight, it's all right,
But why run from what's gon' hold you tight
Through any complications? Baby, maybe we can start tonight...
Hey, I saw the dirty looks you gave me - don't care what your ex do;
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you;
Ain't no one gon' love you like I'm gonna love you...
And if you dare, don't dare send me straight to voice mail - babe, I'm just gon' text you;
Hope it ain't no issue, I just gotta let you
Know no one gon' love you like I'm gonna love you....
See, I, I-I-I-I don't mind you putting up a little bit of fight, it's all right,
But why run from what's gon' hold you tight
Through any complications? Baby, maybe we can start tonight...
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...) 
I put that on everything...
(Ain't no one gonna love you, and ain't no one gonna hold you,
and show you what I can show you...) Somebody better told you... baby!
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...) Baby!
Your name's spelled out in every heartbeat...
(Ain't no one gonna love you, and ain't no one gonna hold you,
and show you what I can show you...)
Oh, but if you should go down that same road you've been before...
(Hopefully you know...) you're in reverse, your pain rehearsed, just brace yourself for the blow...
But don't you know that you could just let it go?
And don't you know I, I, I, I, I been through some things, please don't hold that against me;
(Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you...) No, I'm gonna love you..
(Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you...)
Don't you know I, I, (I'm making you this promise,) clutching on a rosary!
(Ain't no one gon' love you like I'm gonna love you...) Ho... I love you, baby!
(Ain't no one gon' love you like I'm gonna love you...) Hey! Hey, now...
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...) Oh...
I put that on everything...
(Ain't no one gonna love you,) Oh... (and ain't no one gonna hold you,
and show you what I can show you...) Somebody better tell you! Ooh...
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Your name's spelled out in every heartbeat...
(Ain't no one gonna love you,) Baby... (and ain't no one gonna hold you,) Whoo...
and show you what I can show you...) Somebody better told you...
I, I, I been through some things, please don't hold that against me;
Ain't no one gon' love you like I'm gonna love you...
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you...
Even though I, I, I been through some things, please don't hold that against me;
Ain't no one gon' love you like I'm gonna love you...
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you...
