<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Invisible">
Seems like I'm not here
It's like I don't mean nothing
Like glass unclear
Almost like you can see straight through me
I got questions but no answers
So tired of being confused and I
Don't wanna stay right here and I
Gotta find my wings and fly
[Chorus:]
I gotta find me another way
Cause I don't wanna stay another day
Time for a change in my mind
I'v opened my eyes I'm changing my life
And now I'm gonna live my life for me
Cause this ain't how it's supposed to be
No more standing in the back of the line
Cause I'm invisible for the last time
Why can't you see me
Do I really even matter
You changed me completely
And I remember how it used to be
I got question what's the lesson
I'm tired of being confused and I'm
I'm gonna take my chance and fly
I'm taking back my life
[Chorus]
This can't be it for me
This can't be all I'm made for
And all my time wasted in this life
It's my time to shine
No more feeling insufficient
I'm gonna make my own decisions
It don't matter what you can or cannot see
I'm doing this for me
[Chorus]
Can you see me
I know you see me
No more stand in the back of the line
Cause I'm invisible for the last time
