I cannot handle business
I'm lookin' at you, boy
I'm thinkin' about the things we can do and explore
I'm wonderin if you figure
What my body is gonna say
Tell me what it do
Hey, listen, I ain't playin'
So don't bother me
If you get too deep and then you're told
Me and my girls just came to party
It's that simple
If you need to know
I'm about to go
I'm always in my head
That's where to find me
And that's where you wanna be
I'm just that type of girl
Figured I'd let you know
Lookin' for what I need
Tonight is all for me
I'm just that type of girl
Freedom comes and goes
Different I might be
Tonight I'm losing me
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
You and your boys in the refreshin' town
Me and my girls, it's all up in the house, house, house, house
You and your boys in the refreshin' town
Me and my girls, it's all up in the house, house, house, house
So don't bother me
If you get too deep and then you're told
Me and my girls just came to party
It's that simple
If you need to know
I'm about to go
I'm always in my head
That's where to find me
And that's where you wanna be
I'm just that type of girl
Figured I'd let you know
Lookin' for what I need
Tonight is all for me
I'm just that type of girl
Freedom comes and goes
Different I might be
Tonight I'm losing me
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I got, I got what makes a woman irresistible
I'm doing work if you stay in your place, your place
I'm just that type of girl
Figured I'd let you know
Lookin' for what I need
Tonight is all for me
I'm just that type of girl
Freedom comes and goes
Different I might be
Tonight I'm losing me
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
You and your boys in the refreshin' town
Me and my girls, it's all up in the house, house, house, house
You and your boys in the refreshin' town
Me and my girls, it's all up in the house, house, house, house
So what now?
