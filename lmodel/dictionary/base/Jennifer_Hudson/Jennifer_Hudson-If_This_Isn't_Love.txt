<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="If_This_Isn't_Love">
I'm calling his phone up just to tell him how much
I really love him 'cause he's everything I want
He listens to me, cares for me so I truly believe
God sent me an angel from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect only because
It's the only way I can describe, so
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me?
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me?
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
I'm selfish 'cause I don't wanna share him with nobody
Not even those people that came before me
But see, I never believed
God would send me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect only because
It's the only way I can describe, so
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me?
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me?
L-O-V-E, oh
So if you got real love
Lemme see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
The kind of love that fits quite like a glove
Lemme see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
If this isn't love
'Cause I know I ain't crazy
I know I ain't tripping
I know I ain't slipping
I know that it's love
You see me with my hands up
If you think I'm dreaming
I know I ain't dreaming
'Cause this is the reason I love him because
If this isn't love
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this baby
L-O-V-E, what is in me?
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L O V E, what is in me?
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
Love, L-O-V-E
Love, L-O-V-E
