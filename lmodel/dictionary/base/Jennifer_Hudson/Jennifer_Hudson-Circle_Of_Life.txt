<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Circle_Of_Life">
From the day we arrive in the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There is more to be seen
Than can ever be seen
More to do, than can ever be done
In the circle of life
And it moves the sun
Through this baron hole
It's the faith that loves
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding (hihihing)
In the circle, 
THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
On the path unwinding (hihihing)
In the circle,
The circle of LIFE!......
