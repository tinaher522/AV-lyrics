<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Gone">
Can you imagine what it would be like we never met?
We never kissed
Can you imagine if we never got to spend those nights in each other's arms?
Chorus
But i don't know how it feels
But it will probably kill me
Probably it will tear me down
Cause i don't wanna think about it
My heart can't take it if you were gone
If you were gone (repeat)
Can you picture yourself getting over me with someone else
I can't cause i feel like we are the exception to the pool
I know this love is true
Chorus
Don't .. too excited to see what tomorrow brings
You changed my world around and i am not scared to go fall down in love
But if you were gone
If you were gone (repeat)
