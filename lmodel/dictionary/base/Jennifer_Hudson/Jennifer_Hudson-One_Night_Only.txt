<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="One_Night_Only">
You want all my love and my devotion 
You want my love and soul, right on the line 
I have no doubt that I could love you, forever 
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time 
You've got one night only, one night only
That's all you have to spare 
One night only
Let's not pretend to care 
One night only, one night only
Come on, big baby, come on 
One night only
We only have 'til dawn 
In the morning this feeling will be gone
It has no chance going on 
Something so right has got no chance to live 
So let's forget about chances, it's one night I will give
One night only, one night only
You'll be the only one
One night only
Then you have to run
One night only, one night only
There's nothing more to say
One night only
Words get in the way
One night only
One night only
One night only...
