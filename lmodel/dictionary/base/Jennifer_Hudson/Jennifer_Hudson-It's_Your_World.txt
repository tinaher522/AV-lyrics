<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="It's_Your_World">
Anything that you want from me
Boy you can get it any time, any place
I'll be your servant, your slave
Your everything you ever wanted baby
Just make one wish
And I'll become your genie
Your go-get-it, your "bring it back and give it to you" babe
I walk over that rainbow and deliver to you that pot of gold
Got the whole earth in the box, wrapped in a bow for you
It's your world
Yeah it's your world baby
It's your world baby
And everything in it
It's your world
It's your world baby
It's your world
Boy if you ask, it shall be given
It's your world
It's your world
All of your worries, your casual doubts
Give 'em to me and I'll erase them for you
I'll be your heaven, your blessing, no stressing
Boy I'll make all your dreams come true
No matter what it is
Yeah say what it is
And I will do it for you
I'll walk a mile, I'll swim the Nile, I'll vow
Sink my finger in the ground
And turn this earth around for you
It's your world
Yeah it's your world baby
It's your world baby
And everything in it
It's your world
It's your world baby
It's your world
Boy if you ask, it shall be given
It's your world
It's your world
See a woman like you baby
Shouldn't have to ask for nothing baby
No no no
You should have a world baby
Right in the palms of your hands
Just tell me what to do
Make your life a better life for you
Anything your heart desires baby
See I am born to make it happen baby
All you've gotta do... Is tell me that it's me you want loving you
And as long as you keep getting me that sweet love
Point to it baby and it belongs to you
If it's money you want (it's nothing)
Want me to pay your bills (it's nothing)
Buy you nice things (it's nothing)
Shopping sprees (it's nothing)
If you're in need of love (it's nothing)
Boy it don't matter what (it's nothing)
Even the moon and the stars above (it's nothing)
You can have my heart (it's nothing)
You can have my car (it's nothing)
I'll cut it out of me (it's nothing)
And give you my heart (it's nothing)
See that Universe (it's nothing)
And all of the planets (it's nothing)
Belongs to you (it's nothing)
Just reach up and grab it (it's nothing)
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's your world
It's your world baby
You deserve a whole world
And everything in it
It's your world
I'll wrap it up and give it to you
Everything you want
Anything you need
I will surely do
All your hopes and dreams
It's your world
And everything in it
Listen to me
It's your world
