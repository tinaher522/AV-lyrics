<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Moan">
Every day I still hear my momma sayin'
I have to moan
Every way she's still with me every day
In my, in my eyes, in my hopes
She taught me to love
But I can't love, yeah
So I moan
I moan, yeah
Sometimes you got to moan, my momma said
The tears, yeah
Yeah, when I'm down
When I fall
And I can't find
Which way to go
When I'm scared
Scared of missing all
When the pressure is way too much
When I feel like I can't go on, yeah
I start singin' and I moan
Yeah
I start singing, yeah, and I moan
When I go in a deep world
I wanna change
I know I can't
When I'm scared
Scared of messing relations
When the pressure is way too much
When I feel like I can't go on, yeah
I start singin' and I moan
Yeah
I start singing, yeah, and I moan
If I moan, it takes the pain away
It takes the pain away
So when I miss you I start singin' and I moan
My momma taught me, taught me
Never let the pain go nowhere
I would take it, and take it everywhere I go
If you think you've seen it all
You didn't
Keep on livin'
So when I miss you I start singin' and I moan
Sometimes is beyond words
So I got to moan
I think it's better, yes I do
So when you get down
I'm down
When you're low
If you can't find which way to go
You don't know which way to go
When I'm scared and I'm alone
I start singin'
That's what I do, yeah
And I moan
