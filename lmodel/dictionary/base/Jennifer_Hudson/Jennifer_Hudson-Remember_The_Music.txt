<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Remember_The_Music">
Follow my hands
I teach you how to play
I'll be patient with you
Someone who is patient with me
There always be chance that you could hit the wrong note
Everybody could laugh and make you think you won't grow
You don't ever give up, it's not the end of the world
You live and you learn
Even when you think that times get hard
Temporary hurt
All you gotta do is make that call
I'll be there, don't be scared
You don't gotta lose it
Remember the music
Remember the music
In the past it's been hard as hell
You don't know know how much pain I felt
But everybody got a story to tell
Sometimes you got to face the music and play by yourself
But there always be chance that you could hit the wrong note
Everyone could laugh and they don't wanna hear no more
You don't ever give up
It's not the end of the world
You live and you learn
Even when you think that times get hard
Temporary hurt
All you gotta do is make that call
I'll be there, don't be scared
You don't gotta lose it
Remember the music
Remember, it's the answer
Don't you ever forget the music
No
You live and you learn
Even when you think that times get hard
Temporary hurt
All you gotta do is make that call
I'll be there, don't be scared
You don't gotta lose it
Remember the music
