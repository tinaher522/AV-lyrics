<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="I'm_Here">
I don't need you to love me,
I don't need you to love.
I've got . . .
I've got . . .
I got my sister.
I can feel her now,
She may not be here, but she's still mine.
I know that she still love me.
Got my house.
It still keep the cold out.
Got my chair
When my body can't hold out.
Got my hands
Doin' good like they supppose to,
Showin' my heart
To the folks that i'm close to.
Got my eyes,
Though they don't see as far now,
I know more 'bout how things
Really are now . . .
I'm gonna take a deep breath.
I'm gonna hold my head up.
Gonna put my shoulders back,
And look you straight in the eye.
I'm gonna flirt with somebody
As they walk by.
I'm gonna sing out . . .
Sing out.
The tennessee state university choir
I believe i have inside of me
Everything that i need to live a bountiful life.
With all the love alive in me
I'll stand as tall as the tallest tree.
And i'm
Thankful for each day that i'm given,
Both the easy and hard ones i'm livin'.
But most of all
I'm thankful for
Loving who i really am.
I'm beautiful.
Yes, i'm beautiful,
And i'm here.
