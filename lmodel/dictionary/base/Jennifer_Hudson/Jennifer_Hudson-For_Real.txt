<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="For_Real">
Asy, I'm taking it easy
Cause life's too short to give my heart So freely
Simple, what I want is simple..like Falling rain, summer or spring
Here I am
Oh all I know is..lonely ain't that bad Without the tears and without the past And the memories of how I kept hanging On
I am all I need For Real
Cause now I see that what I wanted in You was always in me For Real
Silence, it was beautiful silence after I got over my last heart break it was Quiet
Now hear for, what are here for to Create complications and take me Through changes just tell me now
Oh all I knw is, lonely ain't that bad Without tears and without the past and The memories of how I kept hanging on
I am all I need For Real cause now I See that what I wanted in you was always in me For Real
I was chasing love and it just kept Running, I settled and you wasn't the One. I gave you everything (that's when Our love was real..I don't know why you tired to make me past, what's the reason, boy can you explain?
Never knew how to love me
Maybe that was the point
Maybe its not your fault
Can't blame ya for what cha don't know
(Oh) Should've never trusted you
But now I know that
I am all I need For Real, now I see that what I wanted in you was always in me For Real, For Real
I am all I need For Real, now I see that what I wanted in you was always in me For Real
You thought I wasn't going nowhere
Didn't ya, but I'm happy about it (yes I am) I was depending on you, Now I'm Depending on me....
