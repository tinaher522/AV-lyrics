<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Overjoyed">
Over time, 
I've been buildng my castle of love 
Just for two
Though you never knew you were my reason
Gone much too far, for you now to say
That i've got to fold my castle away
Over dreams 
I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was a view i've been dreaming		
Sandman has gone im too far away 	
For you to say come thats some other day
Chorus
And though you dont believe that 
They do they do come true
For did my dreams come true when i looked at you
And maybe too you would believe you too might be 
Overjoyed over love over me
Over harms i've had painfully turned every stone
Just to find i have found what i searched to dicover
I've come much too far for me not to find
The love that i said could never be mine 
Chorus
And though you dont believe that 
They do they do come true
For did my dreams come true when i looked at you
And maybe too you would believe you too might be 
Overjoyed over love over me
(Reapet)
