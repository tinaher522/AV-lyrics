Where Did All The Good Men Go!
Where Did All The Good Men Go!
Mmm Mmm Mmmm
Where Did They Go!!! Ha
Listen
5:46 In The Morn, She Calls My Phone Mm And She Crying She Says Jenni I Cant Take
It No More Once Again I Cant Find Tyrone, And I'm So Sick Of Him Leaving Me Alone 
Why He Just Wont Stay His Tail At Home, And I All Could Do Is Listen And Hurt For Her.
And Silently Wonder. (Where Did All The The Good Men Go Where Are The Men That 
Still Believe In Honesty, Respect And Monogomy). (Where Did All The Good Men Go
Now Will Somebody Tell Me Where Did They Go Cause Me And My Girls Really Want To
Know). Line At The Grocery Store In Isle 4, Mm When I Heard Her Say. Baby I Wouldnt
Do No More, And I Heard Somebody Fall To The Floor Crying She Said U Said U Wouldnt Hit Me No More
And Then Security Came Running Through The Door, And I Could Do Is Listen And Hurt For Her And Silently Wonderr.
[Repeat]
[Bridge:]
Why Does It Have To Be So Complicated When It Comes To Love.(What God Created It
Beautiful) Where Is The Good Man Tell Me Where Is The Man That Wants Me Ohohoh
[Chorus: Fade Out]
