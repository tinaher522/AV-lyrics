[Verse 1]: 
We might be too good, 
We might be too right, 
Even got them complimentary zodiac signs 
Aesthetically, a sight to see, 
But something about our love 
Don't seem to be enough and, 
[Chorus]: 
What do we do when something so beautiful starts fading? 
Picking at flaws and pulling on a thread, 
I think I know exactly what we're faced with 
Boy, I can't sleep at night, 
Thinkin' bout you got me going crazy, 
Look at how you made me 
Boy you use to hold me tight, 
Now you're actin' like you don't know me 
Baby won't you tell me, 
What we gonna do when the fabric gets thin 
And every little thread, we keep on pulling? 
If it can't work, then we need to let it go 
What we gonna do? (3x) 
[Verse 2]: 
We made mistakes, 
But everytime we fuss boy, 
I can see us slowly starting to break 
No compromise, didn't realize, 
Us pulling strings was wearing us thin 
[Chorus]: 
What do we do when something so beautiful starts fading? 
Picking at flaws and pulling on a thread, 
I think I know exactly what we're faced with 
Boy, I can't sleep at night, 
Thinkin' bout you got me going crazy, 
Look at how you made me 
Boy you use to hold me tight, 
Now you're actin' like you don't know me 
Baby won't you tell me, 
What we gonna do when the fabric gets thin 
And every little thread, we keep on pulling? 
If it can't work, then we need to let it go 
What we gonna do? (3x) 
[Verse 3]: 
Boy, you got me holding on for dear life 
I wanna make it, but the both of us have got to try 
We keep picking and pulling at eachother's threads, yeah 
Every thread counts when you're so inlove together 
So you better get your fabric, 
Make sure that you have it tight 
No time for mistakes, 
Gotta fix it before it ends 
What we gonna do? (3x) 
[Chorus]: 
What do we do when something so beautiful starts fading? 
Picking at flaws and pulling on a thread, 
I think I know exactly what we're faced with 
Boy, I can't sleep at night, 
Thinkin' bout you got me going crazy, 
Look at how you made me 
Boy you use to hold me tight, 
Now you're actin' like you don't know me 
Baby won't you tell me, 
What we gonna do when the fabric gets thin 
And every little thread, we keep on pulling? 
If it can't work, then we need to let it go 
We need to let it go, if it ain't gonna work baby 
What we gonna do? (3x)
