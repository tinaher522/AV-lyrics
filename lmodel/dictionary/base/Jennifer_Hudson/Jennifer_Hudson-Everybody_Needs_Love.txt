<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="Everybody_Needs_Love">
Everybody needs some love,
Needs someone whom they can trust
Someone they can love for life!
Even when the times get rough,
We can make it work,
And we can find love!
If we try we can fly high and touch the sky!
Oh, yes we can!
We can do it if we try,
It's up to you and I,
Sing:
Everybody, everybody,
Somebody who needs love!
If you want it, you can get it
Just trust and believe love!
Wave your hands in the air
Scream more, I need love!
I need love!
Only wants to be loved,
Lonely nights been at home
Waitin by the phone, oh no!
All we gonna do is trust,
We can make it work
We can find love!
If we try we can fly high and touch the sky!
Oh, yes we can!
We can do it if we try,
It's up to you and I,
Sing:
Everybody, everybody,
Somebody who needs love!
If you want it, you can get it
Just trust and believe love!
Wave your hands in the air
Scream more, I need love!
I need love!
If you work hard every day, let me hear you say
I need love, need love!
If you're sick and tired to be lonely, let me hear you say
I need love, need love!
I know it's a lot of you out there
Who think they can't find love,
But I'm here to tell you
If you want it, you can have it!
Just believe it!
Everybody, everybody,
Somebody who needs love!
If you want it, you can get it
Just trust and believe love!
Wave your hands in the air
Scream more, I need love!
I need love! 
Everybody, everybody,
Somebody who needs love!
If you want it, you can get it
Just trust and believe love!
Wave your hands in the air
Scream more, I need love!
I need love!
