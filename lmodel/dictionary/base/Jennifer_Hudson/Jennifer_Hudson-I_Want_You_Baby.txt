<song artist="Jennifer_Hudson" title="I_Want_You_Baby">
I want you baby (I want you)
And I need you baby (I need you)
Oh baby, you got me on my knees (got me on my knees)
You got baby. Baby Baby
Baby Baby. Baby Please
I know you don't trust, the way I feel (the way I feel)
That's why your standing over there
But don't go back on me baby
Believe me believe me, cause I really care oh.
And I want you baby
And I need you I need you I need you, oh baby
You got me on my knees
You got me baby, baby baby.
Baby Baby. Ba ba ba ba baby
Oh I want you baby
I need you baby
Ooh oh baby
I need you baby
Yes I do
I want you
You got me baby
Oooh
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby.
Yes! (baby baby baby)
