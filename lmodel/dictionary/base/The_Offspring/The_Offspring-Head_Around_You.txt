<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Head_Around_You">
Deep inside your soul
There's a hole you don't wanna see
Every single day
What you say makes no sense to me
Even though I try
I can't get my head around you
Somewhere in the night
There's a light in front of me
Heaven up above with a shove
Abandons me
Even though I try
I fall in the river of you
You've managed
To bring me down too
All you're faking
(Get up, get up, get up, get up)
Shows you're aching
(Get up, get up, get up)
Every single day
What you say makes no sense to me
Lettin' you inside, isn't right
Don't mess with me, I never really know
What's really going on inside you?
I can't get my head around you
All you're feeling
(Get up, get up, get up, get up)
Shows you're breathing
(Get up, get up, get up)
Deep inside your soul
There's a hole you don't wanna see
Covering it up
Like a cut with the likes of me
You know I've really tried
I can't do anymore about you
(Yeah)
The cut's getting deeper
(Yeah)
The hill's getting steeper
I guess I'll never know
What's really going on inside you?
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you
