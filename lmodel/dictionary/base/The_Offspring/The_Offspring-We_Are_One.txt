<song artist="The_Offspring" title="We_Are_One">
We are one with ourselves
Don't give a shit about no one else
Well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop
The walls come tumbling down
We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct
We are one, you know it's true
Don't fuck with us, or we'll fuck with you
It's a mentality that kills the best, we better stop
The walls come tumbling down
We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct
We are one, it won't be news
Hang ourselves with one collective noose
Well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop
The walls come tumbling down
We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
