<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Nitro_(Youth_Energy)">
Our generation sees the world
Not the same as before
We might as well just throw it all
And live like there's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
We are the ones
Who are living under the gun, everyday
You might be gone before you know
So live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
Hey, believe it
The official view of the world has changed
In a whole new way
Live fast 'cause if you don't take it 
You'll never make it
So if you understand me
And if you feel the same
Then you will know what nitro means
You'll live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow!
