<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Amazed">
Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown
Cause everyone around's so hollow
And I'm alone.
Sometimes I think I'm going down
But no one makes a sound they follow
And I'm alone.
Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow.
Yeah one more day and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting.
Yeah and if I make it I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
But if I could change
Then I'd really be amazed.
And when you know you can't relate
To one more shiny face, your heart breaks;
No one cares.
And when you know you can't go on
'Cause everything is wrong, your heart breaks;
No one's there.
Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow.
Yeah one more day and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting.
Yeah and if I make it I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
But if I could change
Then I'd really be amazed.
Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow.
Yeah one more day and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting.
Yeah and if I make it I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
But if I could change
Then I'd really be amazed.
