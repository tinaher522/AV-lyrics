<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Bad_Habit">
Hey man, you know I'm really OK
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap
When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off; it makes me insane
Open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh ohh ooh ohh
They say the road's a dangerous place
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
You drive on my ass
Your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh
Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease, something's odd
I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumbshit goddamn motherfucker!
I open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Ohh ohh ooh ohh
