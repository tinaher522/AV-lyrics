<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Race_Against_Myself">
All I want
All I need
Always lies just out of reach
I've been coming up empty
I've ran as fast
As I can run
I pushed as hard as anyone
Still there's nothing for me
I've tried as hard as I can
I've taken all I can stand
But I am running a race
Against myself
Burning out
Strung along
Now my sorrow is my song
My whole world is half-hearted
For my pain
I have none
After all is said and done
Now I'm back where I started
I've gone as far as I can
I've taken all I can stand
But I am running a race
Against myself
I've tried as hard as I can
I've taken all I can stand
But I am losing the race
Against myself
