<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Slim_Pickens_Does_The_Right_Thing_And_Rides_The_Bomb_To_Hell">
Take me for a ride
I'm the one you pushed aside
But it's coming back to you
Yeah, it's coming back to you, hey
We run to the sound
Take it back and double down
'Cause it's coming back to you
Yeah, it's coming back to you
Well ah ah ah, well we're pouring gasoline
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ah ah ah, it will never be the same now
'Cause there's nothing left for us to be
Give it up, the champions of greed
So come around and have another round on me
Dance fucker dance, let the mother fucker burn, hey
Snake is in the grass
While you're living in the past
Say, whatcha you gonna do?
Yeah, whatcha you gonna do, hey?
Earn, never learn
When you're cheering while it burns
And we're coming after you
Yeah, we're coming after you, hey
Slim Pickens, well he does the right thing
And he rides the bomb to hell
Yeah, he rides the bomb to hell
Watch the pulse, it quickens after every little sting
If you're gonna go to hell
Drink it up, you might as well
Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on the missile with the cowboy hat, and
Ah ah ah, well the world is gonna end
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ah ah ah, wanna tear it down again now
'Cause there's nothing left for us to be
Give it up, the sons of anarchy
So come around and have another round on me
Dance fucker dance, let the mother fucker burn, hey
Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on the missile with the baseball bat, and
Ah ah ah, well we're pouring gasoline
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ah ah ah, it'll never be the same
The takers and the liars that we all believed in
Ah ah ah, well we're going down in flames
So dance around the fire
We dance around the fire
'Cause there's nothing left for us to be
Give it up, the champions of grief
So come around and have another round on me
Hey, hey
Dance fucker dance, let the mother fucker burn, hey
