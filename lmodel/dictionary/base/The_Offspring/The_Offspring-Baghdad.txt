<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Baghdad">
In your plane in the blue sky
You roam again
Words that echo in your mind
Make your heart beat faster
This is not Vietnam
We will win in Iraq
The president said, let it ride, ride
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Baghdad
Warrior, the time bomb's about to go
What will you feel?
Will you ever wonder
If the man that's in your sights
Ever kissed his girl goodbye?
The captain said, kill or die, die
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Baghdad
Great satan,
Great satan,
Great satan, (our flags are burning)
Great satan, (our flags are burning)
Great satan, (our flags are burning)
Great satan, (our flags are burning)
Great satan, (our flags will burn!!)
Soon America may find its young men in the sand
Where their casualty is just a number
In Iraq 
The president said, let it ride, ride
You will be damned
Make your last stand
In Baghdad
In Baghdad
In Baghdad!
