<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Genocide">
Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it, we are one
One, two, three, four
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
I find it such a shame
Through the pain I see things as they are
We're served up on a plate
The pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time
We can see the errors of our ways
Would anyone change it anyhow?
Our time is up... one, two, three, four
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
I bet you'd only run
If you saw what goes inside our own
I bet you'd lead the way
If it were up to you to decide
But it's not
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
Like a silver flame
Like a suicide
Like you're giving more
One, two, three, four
