<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Turning_Into_You">
A day to remember
The echoes and embers
Are heavy on my mind
The pictures are broken,
The front door is open
The scars are left behind
Tables turn
Your words they're burning
Leaving me undone
I flinch and shake until I break
I swear to God for once!
Could you just hear me?
Just really hear me..?
I've been drowning in the sea
I've tried to please you
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever knew
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
The music is hurting,
The drugs aren't working
The walls come crushing down
Another rejection
For my insurrection
It's crawling back somehow
Tables turn
These words they burn
I never should have come
I flinch and shake until I break
I swear to God for once
Could you just hear me?
No, really hear me?
I've been drowning in the sea
I've tried to please you
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever knew
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you
I'm not how I used to be,
I'm changing cause of you
I'm screaming just to breathe
It's all that I can do
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you
Any more, find a way, hey, hey
Any more, find a way to there
It's all that I can see
It's all that I can do
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
I've been drowning in the sea
I've tried to please you
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever knew
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you
I'm not how I used to be,
I'm changing 'cause of you
I'm screaming just to breathe
It's all that I can do
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you
Turning into you
