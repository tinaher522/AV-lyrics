<song artist="The_Offspring" title="All_Along">
Deep inside secrets burning
I should have known all the while what's true
I went along, to fool myself
Can't go on, I can't escape it
All along, I think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along, still believed in you
Now I leave here betrayed and broken
Close my eyes from the burning
All along, all the while it's true
Take it on, or turn your back
Either way, you can't escape it
All along, I think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along, still believed in you
Now I leave here betrayed and broken
Ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
All along, I think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along, still believed in you
Now I leave here betrayed and broken
All along I still believed in you
