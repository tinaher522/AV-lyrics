<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Come_Out_Swinging">
You brace and hold it all inside
It's more than you can stand
No one around even tries
Tries to understand
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging, come out alone
They're in your way, they're in your way
But as long as you're swinging strong then you'll get by
Your pacing's wearing out a line
Right beside your bed
The scene replays a million times
Stuck inside your head
And though you stay in place
Your mind escapes
Read between the lies
Smile's on your face
You fake like you're okay
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging, out on your own
They're in your way, they're in your way
You may be stinging, but you'll get by
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging, never alone again
The pain inside can guide your way
Midnight, no sleep though
Inside, you scream to
No one, hears you for
Daylight, prove me today, day
One more try
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging, come out alone
They're in your way, they're in your way
You may be stinging, but you'll get by
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging, never alone again
The pain inside
Leads you (leads you) through so you'll get by
