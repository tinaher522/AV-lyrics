<song artist="The_Offspring" title="So_Alone">
Look at the crowd and tell me whether
All are surrounded
But none are together
If you're awake
Look all around at
All of the people
Still you're so alone
So alone
So alone
So alone
So alone
If I could make a suggestion
Without sounding preachy
Or begging the question
Meld with your minds
Meld with each other
Don't be surrounded
Don't be so alone
So alone
So alone
So alone
(Kill)
(Fuck off)
(Hate)
(Die)
