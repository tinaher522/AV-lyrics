<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Killboy_Powerhead">
He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer step
He always busts his knuckles
When he's wrenchin' up his shit
He's a killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Yeah
You know I saw his woman
She was writin' his name in blood
You know I saw his woman
Hard as a rock
She said she was his baby
Who looked just like the Hoover Dam
You know I saw his woman
Hard as a rock
He's a killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Yeah
He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer step
He always busts his knuckles
When he's wrenchin' up his shit
He's a killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead, yeah
Killboy powerhead, yeah
Killboy powerhead, yeah
