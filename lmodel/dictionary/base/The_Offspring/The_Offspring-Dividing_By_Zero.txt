<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Dividing_By_Zero">
Oh take me higher all the way to the sun 
Down to the wire fightings only begun 
It's closing it on you, closing it on you 
One from the fire when you're down on you 
It's closing it on you, closing it on you 
Oh you know it all oh oh 
I will persevere, I will resist to here 
I will leave the fear 
I'm not the only son, my will will be done 
I'm the scent begun 
It's closing it on you, closing it on you 
One from the fire when you're down on you 
It's closing it on you, closing it on you 
Oh, you know it all 
Gonna make it through, gonna make it through 
Divide by zero like a wrecking crew 
Closing it on you, closing it on you oh 
And know it all oh oh 
Don't take me higher I'm waiting the sun 
I will persevere I will resist to here 
I will leave the fear 
It's closing it on you, closing it on you 
One from the fire when you're down on you 
Closing it on you, closing it on you 
Oh, you know it all oh 
Gonna make it through, gonna make it through 
Divide by zero like a wrecking crew
Closing it on you, closing it on you 
And know it all oh oh
