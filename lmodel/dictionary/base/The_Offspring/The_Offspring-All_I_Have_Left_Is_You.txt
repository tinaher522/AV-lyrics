<song artist="The_Offspring" title="All_I_Have_Left_Is_You">
I’ll be the one, spin me around
Lifting you up, and holding me down
Inside a storm is raging, it blows up in your eyes
Inside a heart is breaking, rivers running dry
I could run, i could hide
When i’m crashing down who’s the one who saves me?
Oh, intertwined, wrap around me with your thorns
And we’re holding on when
There’s nothing left to hold on to
So don’t tell me when it’s gone
Cause’ all i have left is you
Out of love, out of time
When i’m falling down you’re the one who saved me
Oh, intertwined, wrap around me now with your thorns
And we’re holding on when
There’s nothing left to hold on to
So don’t tell me when it’s gone
Cause’ all i have left is you
When there’s nothing left to hold onto
So don’t tell me when it’s gone
Cause’ all i have left, all i have left is you
I’ll be the one lifting you up again
Inside a storm is raging, hold me down, hold me down
I’ll be here waiting, i’ll be here waiting for
And we’re holding on when
There’s nothing left to hold on to
So don’t tell me when it’s gone
Cause’ all i have left is you.
