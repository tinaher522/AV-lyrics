<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Hey_Joe">
Hey Joe, 
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand? 
Hey Joe, 
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand? 
Said I'm gonna go down to shoot my old lady 
I caught her messing around with another man, 
Said I'm gonna go down to shoot my old lady 
I caught her messing around on me, 
Hey Joe, 
I heard that you shot your old lady down,
Hey Joe, 
I heard you caught your old lady fucking some other guy and you shot her down
Well you know, I guess that's true
I guess you can say I shot her her down
Yes I did, I shot her down
I took out my gun, 
Then I shot her down!
Hey Joe, 
Where you gonna run to now? 
Hey Joe, 
Where you gonna run to now? 
Where you gonna go? 
Ain't no hangman gonna, 
Get a rope around me, 
Ain't no hangman gonna, 
Get a rope around me. (no one gonna) 
Goin' way down south, 
Way down to Mexico way 
Goin' way down south, 
Way down where I can be free
