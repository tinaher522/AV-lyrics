<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Beheaded_'99">
Mommy doesn't have her head anymore
Keep it underneath my bed on the floor
That's alright though
That's ok
She never really used her head anyway
Daddy called me a silly bore
Bet he wont say that anymore
Because the way his body's severed in two
His vocal chords are gonna be hard to use
[CHORUS]
Beheaded
Watch you spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded
Bloody mess all over my clothes
Watch my girlfriend come to the door
Chop off her head, she falls to the floor
Watching my baby's jugular flow
Really makes my motor go
Wrap a towel around the bloody stump
Take my baby's body to the city dump
Then wipe the mess off the bloody axe
Scoop all the heads in my burlap sack
[CHORUS]
All my collection
Adorns my rooms on bamboo poles
Used to be a little
But a little got more and more
Now I'm craving yours
Night brings bad dreams
Bad dreams and guillotines
Off with her head
Find another victim for my machine
Put him in a homemade guillotine
Blade falls, gonna need a casket
Watch the head plop in a wicker basket
Leave the house at a quarter to four
Come back with sixteen or more
Cause the more I want, the more I see
Got a funny feeling coming over me
[CHORUS]
