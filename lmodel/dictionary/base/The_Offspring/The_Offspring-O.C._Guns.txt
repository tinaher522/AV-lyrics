<song artist="The_Offspring" title="O.C._Guns">
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes? 
You hijo de puta! Pendejo! Cabron!
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes?
Shoot them in the back when the beat, beat on
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes? 
Chingala you puta! Pendejo! Cabron!
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes?
Shoot them in the back when the beat, beat on
Funk ass gonna get it all right
O.C. guns gonna come out tonight
Me and muy borracho come and go
2 in the front seat and 2 in the back
Nothing good gonna come out of that
They live it fast, you rolling slow
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes? 
You hijo de puta! Pendejo! Cabron!
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes?
Shoot them in the back when the beat, beat on
One shot gonna make it alright
O.C. guns gonna come out tonight
Take a look at that, vaya con Dios!
2 in the front seat and 2 in the back
Nothing good gonna come out of that
They live it fast, you rolling slow
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes? 
You hijo de puta! Pendejo! Cabron!
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes?
Shoot them in the back, a-shoot them in the back
Follow me to a bottomless sea
Come out on top underneath the palm trees (just some real)
Take it light where the sun shines bright
The boom boom boom is gonna drown out the night
Just be a
I got to say what you are thinking
You’ve got to have it all day long
God’s gift you take it without blinking
What was your swan is now your song
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes? 
You hijo de puta! Pendejo! Cabron!
Tiki tiki tiki tiki waddup Holmes?
Shoot them in the back, a-shoot them in the back
I’m going, i’m going down, down
I’m going down, down, down.
Watch from this butch, watch with care
Watch from the pussy from the passenger
