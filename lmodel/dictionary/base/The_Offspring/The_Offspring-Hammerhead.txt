<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Hammerhead">
I am the one
Camouflage and guns
Risk my life
To keep my people from harm
Authority
Vested in me
I sacrifice
With my brothers in arms
Through this doorway
What's on the other side
Never knowing
Exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded
Voices screaming
Let's go!
Come on, do it!
Here we go
I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
I'll shut my eyes; it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
I'll take a life; ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
It's playing over and over in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
Stay the course
Reasonable force
I believe I serve a greater good
Smoke and dust
Enemies are crushed
Nothing left
Where a man once stood
Through this doorway
What's on the other side
Never knowing
Exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded
Voices screaming
Let's go!
But I'm just doing what I'm told
I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
I'll shut my eyes; it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
I'll take this life; ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
It's playing over and over in my head
Where it begins and where it'll end, nobody knows
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
In my head
In my head
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil for thou art with me
Locked and loaded
Gonna find my truth now
I'm busting through
All hell breaks loose
And you can all hide behind your desks now
And you can cry, "Teacher, come help me!"
Through you all
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
