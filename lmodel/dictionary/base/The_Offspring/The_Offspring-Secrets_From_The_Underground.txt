<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Secrets_From_The_Underground">
Feel the way it grows when the words have left a mark 
With a promise of tomorrow, 
That drinks and leaves you in the dark 
There's something in the air, 
And there's something rising up 
Not one but a million that have had enough 
Hey yo, no, I'm not gonna go away 
I got something more to say 
Kick and scream, It knocks you down, it knocks you down 
Hey yo, go, underneath we'll tear you down 
Secrets from the underground, 
Anger starts a fire! 
This is not an anthem, 
Or a threat in someone's name 
But a promise that tomorrow 
Will rock and burn, if things don't change 
There's something in the air, 
And There's something rising up 
Not one but a million that have had enough!
Had enough
Hey yo, no, I'm not gonna go away 
I got something more to say 
Kick and scream, It knocks you down, it knocks you down 
Hey yo, go, underneath we'll tear you down 
Secrets from the underground, 
Anger starts a fire! 
Oh, oh, oh, Underneath we'll tear you down 
Oh, oh, oh, secrets from the underground 
Hey, yo, no
I'm not gonna go away 
I got something more to say 
Kick and scream, It knocks you down, it knocks you down 
Hey yo, go, underneath I'll tear you down 
Secrets from the underground, 
Anger starts a fire! 
Hey yo, go 
Hey yo, go 
Secrets from the underground, 
Anger starts a fire!
