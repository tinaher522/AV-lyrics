<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Spare_Me_The_Details">
My girlfriend, my dumb donut
Went up to a party just the other night
But three hours later and seven shots of Jaeger
She was in the bedroom with another guy
And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't  wanna hear
About your feet all up in the air
And well I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So spare me the details if you don't mind
Now I can understand friends who wanna tell me
They think they're gonna help me, open up my eyes
But the play by play makes me wanna lose it
Everytime you do it man, it turns the knife
And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About your feet all up in the air
And well I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So spare me the details if you don't mind
Now I don't need to hear about the sounds they were makin'
And I don't need to hear about how long it was takin'
Or how the walls, they were shakin'
Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow
Missin' the tomorrow that we could have had
Running through my head, over and over
Things I never told her that just made me sad
And it drives me insane sittin' with a vision
Stuck with that image burned into my brain
And it feels so dumb that I could ever trust her
When someone else fucked her, then walked away
And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air
And so I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So spare me the details if you don't mind
'Cause I don't wanna know
Don't wanna know
(Spare me the details if you don't mind)
Don't wanna know
(Spare me the details if you don't mind)
Don't wanna know...
