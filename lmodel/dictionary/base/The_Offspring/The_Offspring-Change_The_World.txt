<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Change_The_World">
I see the way the salesmen stare into the sun
I stood and watched them as they fell off one by one
And everyone's so blind
They're not to help mankind
Reach into your bag of tricks and pull another one
(Wohhh) You don't want to change the world like you say
(Wohhh) You're in it for yourself, no one else
You're ready saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
You're ready saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
Now when the day is set they'll line up all the same
And those that need the most will never get or gain
The ones you call your friends
Are failing you again
Reach into your bag of tricks and make it go away
(Wohhh) You don't want to change the world like you say
(Wohhh) You're in it for yourself, no one else
You're ready saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
You're ready saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
And since you ain't what you say
Then just go away
Cause some don't lie
Some don't lie
Go on now they won't tell
Go on now and save yourself
Go on now they won't tell
Go on now and save yourself
Go on now they won't tell
Go on now and save yourself
Go on now they won't tell
Go on now and save yourself
I said
(Wohhh) You don't want to change the world like you say
(Wohhh) You're in it for yourself, no one else
You're ready saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
You're ready saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
And since you ain't what you say
Then just go away
Cause some don't lie
Some don't lie
(I think you guys should try heavy metal. Kiss my ass! Ha ha ha ha!)
