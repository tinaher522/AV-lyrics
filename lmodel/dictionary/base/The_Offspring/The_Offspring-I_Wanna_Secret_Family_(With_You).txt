<song artist="The_Offspring" title="I_Wanna_Secret_Family_(With_You)">
Every girl’s a story, call her Morning Glory.
She works at the Pink Pony, oohh.
Dancing on the table, married but he's able.
Holding up his dollars, pointing as he hollers.
It’s you!
Well you knock me out baby,
I wanna secret family with you.
Well you knock me out baby.
It’s too big to bag on, gotta get my swag on.
Looking for an add-on, oohh.
Standing in the mirror, tryin' to get you nearer.
Funking misdemeanor, and this is what he said:
I been a lonely man,
Such a lonely man.
I been a lonely man,
Such a lonely man.
It’s you!
Well you knock me out baby,
I wanna secret family with you.
Well you knock me out baby.
First we went to the buffet,
With the cell phone put away.
Girl you dope like D.E.A.
And it's bigger than both of us.
It’s you!
Well you knock me out baby,
I wanna secret family with you.
And it's alright!
I been a lonely man,
Such a lonely man.
I been a lonely man,
Such a lonely man.
Now I've got you!
Well you knock me out baby,
I wanna secret family with you.
Well you knock me out baby.
First we went to the buffet,
With the cell phone put away.
Girl you dope like D.E.A.
And it's bigger than both of us.
It’s you!
Well you knock me out baby,
I wanna secret family with you.
Start a secret family with you.
And it's alright!
Yeah it's alright!
