<song artist="The_Offspring" title="I_Got_A_Right">
Anytime I want
I got a right to move
No matter what they say
Said anytime I want
I got a right to move
No matter what they say
'Cause I got a right
A right to move
Anytime I want
Any old time
Said I got a right
A right to move
Anytime I want
Anytime I want
I got a right to say
No matter what they say
Said anytime I want
I got a right to say
No matter what they say
'Cause I got a right
A right to say
Anytime I want
Any old time
'Cause I got a right
A right to say
Anytime I want
Anytime I want
I got a right to move
No matter what they say
Said anytime I want
I got a right to move
No matter what they say
'Cause I got a right
A right to move
Anytime I want
Any old time
'Cause I got a right
A right to move
Anytime I want
I got a feeling
I got a feeling
I got a feeling
I got a right
I got a right
I got a right
