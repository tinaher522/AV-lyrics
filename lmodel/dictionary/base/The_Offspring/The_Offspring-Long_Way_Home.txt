<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Long_Way_Home">
Hey! I'm driving down a dusty road
Hey! I've got nowhere to go
Hey! No place that I can call my own
On and on this road is burning
Break away! I'm leaving all this crap behind
Break away! The past is gone the future's blind
Break away! Don't care how long it takes this time
On and on I'll take the long way home 
The long way home
The long way home
If it's for me it's on the way home
Hey! Like fragments of a broken mind
Hey! I splinter by my own design
Hey! The search is not a waste of time
On and on this road keeps burning
Break Away! My hands are glued upon the wheel
Break Away! The road ahead is all I feel
Break Away! The only thing left that's real
On and on I'll take this long way home
The long way home
The long way home
I will go alone 
I will go and find it on my own
What lays ahead you cannot find for me
On and on I'll take the long way home
The long way home
The long way home
If it's for me it's on the way home
The long way home
I'll take the long way home
I will go alone
I will go and find it on my own
