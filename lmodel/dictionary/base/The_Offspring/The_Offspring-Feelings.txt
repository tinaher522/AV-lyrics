Feelings
Nothing more than feelings
Trying to forget my
Feelings of hate
Imagine
Beating on your face
Trying to forget my
Feelings of hate
Feelings
For all my life i'll feel it
I wish I'd never met you
You'll make me sick again
Feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Of hate on my mind
Feelings
Feelings like I never liked you
Feelings like I want to kill you
Live in my heart
Feelings
Feelings like I wanna deck you
Feelings like I've gotta get you
Out of my life
Feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Hate's in my eyes
Feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
You're not very nice
Go!
Feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Hate's on my mind
Feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Get out of my life
Feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Woh-oh-oh feelings
Get out of my life
