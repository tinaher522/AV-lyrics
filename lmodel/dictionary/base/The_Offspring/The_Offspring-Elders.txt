<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Elders">
When we younger
There always seemed like
Some perfect mold
That we're supposed to be
But now we're growing up and
I see it's just not that way
Now I feel like someones lied to me
Cause I've been true
Made good for you
And now I feel used
I'm asking you
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be like you
Tell me now elders
What were your reasons for
Making it seem
Like you were so much more
If you want to feel good
Because of our accomplishments
Why the fuck
Don't you just do it yourself
Cause I've tried
Man I've tried
While you all lied
So now just tell me
How does it feel
How does it feel
