<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Smash">
Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I've held it all in with blood on my face
Built it up man, so bad you can taste
I don't slag no one, I don't even judge
Don't give a shit 'cause I'm not gonna budge
I just want to be who I want to be
Yeah, this is hard for others to see
I'm not a trendy asshole
I do what I want
Do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
I don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
'Cause I am alive
Smash is the way you feel all alone
Like an outcast, you're out on your own
Smash is the way you deal with your life
Like an outcast, you're smashing your strife
Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I just want to be who I want to be
Yeah, this is hard for others to see
I'm not a trendy asshole
Do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
'Cause I am alive
Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now I don't wanna do it no more
Just wanna be who I wanna be
Yeah, this is hard for others to see
I'm not a trendy asshole
I do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
'Cause I am alive
I am alive! 
I am alive!
"There! I hope you enjoyed our time together today. You know it seems harder and harder to just sit back and enjoy the finer things in life. Well, 'til next time... Ta ta!"
