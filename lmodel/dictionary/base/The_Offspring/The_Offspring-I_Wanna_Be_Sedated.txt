<song artist="The_Offspring" title="I_Wanna_Be_Sedated">
Twenty twenty twenty-four hours to go 
I wanna be sedated 
Nothing to do, nowhere to go, ho 
I wanna be sedated 
Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane 
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane 
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain 
Oh no, oh oh, oh oh 
Twenty twenty twenty-four hours to go 
I wanna be sedated 
Nothing to do, nowhere to go, ho 
I wanna be sedated 
Just put me in a wheelchair, put me on a plane 
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane 
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain 
Oh no oh oh oh oh 
Twenty twenty twenty-four hours to go 
I wanna be sedated 
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go, ho 
I wanna be sedated 
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show 
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco 
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes 
Oh no oh oh oh oh 
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show 
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco 
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes 
Oh no oh oh oh oh 
Bam-bam-bambam, ba bam-bam-bambam, I wanna be sedated 
Bam-bam-bambam, ba bam-bam-bambam, I wanna be sedated 
Bam-bam-bambam, ba bam-bam-bambam, I wanna be sedated 
Bam-bam-bambam, ba bam-bam-bambam, I wanna be sedated
