<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Staring_At_The_Sun">
Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I won't let them
If I seem bleak
Well, you'd be correct
And if I don't speak
It's 'cause I can't disconnect
But I won't be burned by the reflection
Of the fire in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
Hey!
When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway
Hey!
When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away
Hey!
There's more to living than only surviving
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying
Though you hear me
I don't think that you relate
My will is something
That you can't confiscate
So forgive me
But I won't be frustrated
By destruction in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
Hey!
When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway
Hey!
When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away
Hey!
There's more to living than only surviving
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying
Though you hear me
I don't think that you relate
My will is something
That you can't confiscate
So forgive me
But I won't be frustrated
By destruction in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
Hey!
Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Hey!
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way
Hey!
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I won't let them
If I seem bleak
Well, you'd be correct
And if I don't speak
It's 'cause I can't disconnect
But I won't be burned by the reflection
Of the fire in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun
