<song artist="The_Offspring" title="OC_Guns">
Tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, what up Holmes?
Huero, Chingada, puto, Pendejo, Cabron
Tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, what up Holmes?
Shoot him in the back with the big beat on
Punk ass gonna get it all right
OC guns gonna come out tonight
Look at muy boracho come and go
Two in the front seat, two in the back
Nothing good gonna come outta that
They're living fast and rollin' slow
Tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, what up Holmes?
Hijo de Puta, Pendejo, Cabron
Tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, what up holmes?
Shoot him in the back with the big beat on
One shot gonna make it all right
OC Guns gonna come out tonight
Take a look at that vaya con Dios
Two in the front seat, two in the back
Nothing good gonna come outta that
They're living fast and rollin' slow
Follow me to a bottomless sea
Come out on top underneath the palm trees
Got some real
Take it light where the sun shines bright
The boom boom boom is gonna drown out the night
Pancho Villa
I've got to say what you are thinking
You've got to have it all day long
God's gift you take it without blinking
What was your swan is now your song
