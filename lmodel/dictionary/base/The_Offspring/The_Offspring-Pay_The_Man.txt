<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Pay_The_Man">
See the way the wind blows
Lives are intertwined
Watch the way the world goes
The man deals out our plight
Jester in the corner
Laughs without a sound
Jester in the corner
Malady abounds
In our souls
In our souls
In our souls
See the way the sun sets
Twilight of this life
The man is making little bets
Playing with our lives
All that I believe now
Anything is possible
A simple explanation
For the evil in this world
And in our souls
In our souls
In our souls
In our souls
Come down to sorry and sable
It's always the man
It's always been keeping you down!
Bow down 'cause I see it before me
Shadow and light
That always keeps you running
Shut up! You talk too much!
Pay the man now, yeah!
Shut up! You talk too much!
No! No! No!
Look at you and your struggle for freedom
But you ain't nothing
We all pay the man for living
Wouldn't it be nice for a change now
To be unchained?
My life is for me now
But this is life!
This is life!
This is life!
This is life!
Pay the man!
No!
Pay the man!
No!
Pay the man!
No!
Pay the man!
No!
Shut up! You talk too much!
Pay the man now, yeah!
Shut up! You talk too much!
Shut up! You talk too much!
Pay the man now, yeah.
My life is for me...
