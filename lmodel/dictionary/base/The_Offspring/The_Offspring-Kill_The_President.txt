<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Kill_The_President">
In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours
Kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy
In a world without leaders
Who'd make people starve?
The world that we're saving
Will always be ours
Everyone says, well maybe I'll make a difference
Thinking they've got plenty of time
But you're squeezed a little tighter everyday
Punished before you can commit a crime
In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours
Kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy
America, all of your enemies come from within
But you lash out so it is seen like some frightened child
In an angry world or the fall of Rome
Your demise comes from your own hands
In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours
In a world without leaders
We might have a chance
But we'll never see it
As long as there's
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president now!
