<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Hit_That">
The winds of fortune don't blow the same
She had to get out and make a change
She had a kid now but much too young
That baby daddy's out having fun
He's saying I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby momma, she ain't so slow
He's saying I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
I know you want to hit that
I know you want to hit that, hit that
All the world is gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way
That's the way things go
Hey, hey, hey
What was a family is now a shell
We're raising kids now who raise themselves
Sex is a weapon, it's like a drug
It gets him right into that grave that he just dug
She's saying I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
Her baby daddy, it ain't his only one
She's saying I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
I know you want to hit that
I know you want to hit that, hit that
Everybody's gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way
That's the way things go
Hey, hey, hey
Well it winds up broken up 
Really such a shame
But why not take a chance
Everything's a game
And it don't stop hooking up
Nothing's gonna change
The more he's trying
The more he's buying
He says I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby momma don't need to know
He's saying I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
I know you want to hit that
I know you want to hit that, hit that
All the world is gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way
That's the way things go
