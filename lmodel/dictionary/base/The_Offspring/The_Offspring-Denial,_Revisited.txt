<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Denial,_Revisited">
So here we go
Having the same old fight again
There she goes
Same old game that never ends 
If I could say
All the right words
I know I could make you stay
If I could say
All the right words
Things would work out all right
And if you go
I won't believe
That it's forever
And you can go
But I'll never leave
Cause it's not over
Replay last night
Talking it out don't make it right
I know she's tried, but my whole world
Is her and all we've got now
And if you go
I won't believe
That it's forever
I won't let go
Even if she says that it's over
I know it'll be
Different this time
If you'd just stay
And when we wrote this story
How did it end?
It was you and me for all our lives
Come on, don't say it
We'll try again
And if I'd just hold you
We could last
But she stands softly
Tears down her face
Hitting me, oh god
This is the end
I'd wait here for you
But there's nothing more now I can do
How did you know...
How did you know...
How did you know...
Finally
