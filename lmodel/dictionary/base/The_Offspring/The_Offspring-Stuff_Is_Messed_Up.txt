<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Stuff_Is_Messed_Up">
Now I don't know when
It's hard to explain
But it seems like things
Are just kind of insane
Because the world is crying
But nobody is listening
So please leave a message on my cell phone
I see bullets getting better
Biblical weather
And the guy on TV
Is like a total asshole
Who are you wearing tonight?
Celebrity fundraiser type
Black ties making wrongs right
How's your social band-aid?
I don't know much, I don't know too much
But I know this: shit is fucked up
La la la la la
I guess it's all about the dream
La la la la la
The ends justify the means
La la la la la la la
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
La la la la la
You know it's all about the dream
La la la la la
The ends justify the means
La la la la la la la
Now thank God for the media
For saving the day
Putting it all into perspective
In a responsible way
With more celebrity news
Typical bullshit and views
I think we're losing this fight
Sponsored by Bud Light
And now we're rocking the casbah
And taking the flag
The genie's out of the bottle
And we can't put it back (Put it back)
All this stuff
It's overwhelming my brain
Can't you see the storm coming?
It's coming this way
I don't know much, I don't know too much
But I know this: shit is fucked up
La la la la la
I guess it's all about the dream
La la la la la
The ends justify the means
La la la la la la la
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
La la la la la
You know it's all about the dream
La la la la la la
The ends justify the means
La la la la la la la
They justify the means
Shopping sprees, RPGs, ecstasy, atrophy
Genocide, pimp my ride, politize, euphemize
Injustice everywhere, apathy, I don't care
Hurricanes, climate change, huh
Therapy, I won't tell, rehab, and LOL
Worldwide calamity, TV reality
Euthanize, supersize, death squads, and boob jobs
And VIP infamy, gratify instantly
I don't know much, I don't know too much
I don't know much, I don't know too much
La la la la la
I guess it's all about the dream
La la la la la la
The ends justify the means
La la la la la la la
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
La la la la la
You know it's all about the dream
La la la la la la
The ends justify the means
La la la la la la la
The means
The means
