<song artist="The_Offspring" title="She's_Got_Issues">
I'm seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind
Well she's got baggage and it's all the emotional kind
She talks about closure and that validation bit
I don't mean to be insensitive, but I really hate that shit
And I say yeah, yeah
Oh man she's got issues and I'm gonna pay
Yeah, yeah
She thinks she's the victim, yeah
Now I know she'll feel abandoned if I don't stay over late
And I know she's afraid to commit, but it's only our second date
And I say yeah, yeah
Oh man she's got issues and I'm gonna pay
Yeah, yeah
She says she's the victim and she takes it all out on me
I don't know why you're messed up
I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favor
And check your baggage at the door
Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind
But when she calls out his name in bed, that's where I draw the line
You told me a hundred times how your father left and he's gone
But I wish you wouldn't call me "daddy" when we're gettin' it on
And I say yeah, yeah
Oh man, she's got issues and I'm gonna pay
Yeah, yeah
She's playing the victim and taking it all out on me
Yeah, yeah
My god, she's got issues and I'm gonna pay
Gonna pay, gonna pay, gonna pay, gonna pay, gonna pay, gonna pay
If you think I'm controlling
Then why do you follow me around
If you're not codependent
Then why do you let others drag you down
I don't know why you're messed up
I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favor
And check your baggage at the door
