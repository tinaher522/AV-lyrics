<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Session">
Aaah, fuck! Fuck fuck fuck!
I don't know when it got this way
I don't know how long she's gonna stay
Every week it's the same
In her room, that's why I came
Here I go, I go again
Our rendezvous never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session
I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)
I'll never see (session)
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold
Got a, got a hold on me
Some might say it's a fling
For all I know it don't mean a thing
Either way I can't complain
Ain't no strings, guess I got it made
Here I go, I go again
The little things never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session
I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)
I'll never see (session)
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold
Got a, got a hold on me
Here I go, I go again
The little things never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session
I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)
I'll never see (session)
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold
Got a, got a hold on me
