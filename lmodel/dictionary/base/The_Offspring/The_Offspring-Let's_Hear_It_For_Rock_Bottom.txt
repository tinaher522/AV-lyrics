<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Let's_Hear_It_For_Rock_Bottom">
In my perfect isolation
I can stay here for a while
Antidotes and revelations
Just extend my own exile
Wasting away
The world's right in front of me
Funny you should say
That it's all in my head
Wasting away
We're hitting rock bottom
And going down in flames
Well it's not that bad
With my lack of observation
I can stay in here for days
Could you find my motivation?
Oh, I can't see it through this haze
Wasting away
The world's right in front of me
Funny you should say
That it's all in my head
Wasting away
We're hitting rock bottom
And going down in flames
Well it's not that bad
Wishing away
The world's right in front of me
Call me anyway
'Cause it's all in my head
Wasting away
We're hitting rock bottom
And going down in flames
Well it's not that bad
Wasting all my days
What would Ivan say?
Wasting all my days
What would Ivan say?
Wasting away
We're hitting rock bottom
And call me anyway
'Cause I got two friends
Wasting away
We're going down together
And all in all, it's not so bad
All in all, it's not so bad
All in all, it's not so bad
It's hard to know
Where to start and where to go
I will never say these words again
Wasting away
The world's right in front of me
Funny you should say
That it's all in my head
Wasting away
We're hitting rock bottom
And going down in flames
Well it's not that bad
Wishing away
The world's right in front of me
Call me anyway
'Cause it's all in my head
Wasting away
We're hitting rock bottom
And going down in flames
Well it's not that bad
Wasting away
Call me anyway
Wasting away
Going down in flames
Well it's not that bad
Wishing away
Call me anyway
Wasting away
Going down in flames
Well it's not that bad
