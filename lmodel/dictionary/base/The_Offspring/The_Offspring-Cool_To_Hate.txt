<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Cool_To_Hate">
I hate a lot of things, I hate a lot of people that are lame,
I like to hate stuff, 'cause then I don't have to try and make a change
I hate teachers, I hate school,
I hate the cheerleaders and anyone who's cool, yea
I hate the office, I hate the quad, don't wanna learn nothing
I wanna be a slob

It's cool to hate, (hey, ooh, ooh) it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin', and I like that fine
It's cool to hate, (hey, ooh, ooh) it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Yeah, I hate everything, I even hate you too, so FUCK YOU!
I'm always thinkin' bad, I never have nothin' good to say
I'd rather tear things down than build them up,
it's easier that way
I hate the jocks and I hate the geeks,
I hate the trendies but I also hate the freaks, yea
I hate Doc Martens and Muscle T's
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery

It's cool to hate, (hey, ooh, ooh) it's cool to hate
Liking something's just a waste of time
It's cool to hate, (hey, ooh, ooh) it's cool to hate
Liking something's just a waste of time
Liking something's just a waste of time
Yeah, I hate everything, I even hate me too, so FUCK YOU!
(hey, hey, hey)
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
I'll cut you down and give you lip
Bein' positive's so unhip
I'll cut you down 'cause I'm a fool
Bein' positive's so uncool
Bein' positive's so uncool
Bein' positive's so uncool
So, I hate the jocks and I hate the geeks,
I hate the trendies, but I also hate the freaks, yea
I hate your band and I hate TV,
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery

It's cool to hate, (hey, ooh, ooh) it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
It's cool to hate, (hey, ooh, ooh) it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Yeah, I hate everything, I even hate you too, so FUCK YOU!!
