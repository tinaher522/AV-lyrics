<song artist="The_Offspring" title="Hurting_As_One">
Been reaching for a reason for the pain that's come (oh, oh, oh)
Been waiting for the season when the healing's done (Oh, oh, oh)
Well, line up in black and white
This blood runs red on both sides
Broken in two,
Hurting as one
Hurting as one
Hurting as one
Hurting as one
Hurting as...
See the battle now it's raging in our hearts and minds
Hear the voices how they're shouting out the others' crimes
Well, our past lies dressed in white
We're all just dragged to the fight
Broken in two,
Hurting as one
Hurting as one
Hurting as one
Hurting as
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Line up in black and white
This blood runs red on both sides
Our past now thrown aside (thrown aside)
We're all just dragged to the fight
Broken in two,
Hurting as one
Hurting as one
Hurting as one
We could be one
We could be one
We're coming undone
We could be one
Hurting as
