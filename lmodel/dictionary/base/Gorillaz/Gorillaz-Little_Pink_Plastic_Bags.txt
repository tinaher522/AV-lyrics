<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Little_Pink_Plastic_Bags">
There just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on a highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They just gonna float out
Hoh oh oho oh
There just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on a highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They just gonna float out
Hoh oh oho oh
Oh
What you gonna write(ride?)
????
What you want tonight
Someone who'll go and get by (???)
There just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on a highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They just gonna float out
Hoh oh oho oh
There just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on a highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They just gonna float out
Hoh oh oho oh
