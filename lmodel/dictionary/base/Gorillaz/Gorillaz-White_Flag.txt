Bashy:
Hey
Look
Yo!
No castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
and mommy ain't said 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet.
I ain't Jesus, but i'm walkin' on water.
There's no bums here, there's no wall cause:
I can break out of jail with a lighter,
so is there any point in makin' laws blood?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore.
No Rain. Condoms get poured
Up the road, you'll never guess who I saw.
Kano:
It's K.A. look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym.
Honey, I'm home. This is where I wanna live.
Just found it like Nemo
on the d-low.
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though:
on the other side of the fence.
Bind to the ends.
Look:
No fence, no stress, no rent, no superficial shit,
this real flow.
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold,
and the speech goes like, "Hi little lady."
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby.
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy.
Swag up on a hundred degrees, not eighty.
Look, if heaven had a VIP
this is it: white sand, blue sea,
but I don't know who they are,
and I'm damn sure they don't know me,
but I come in peace!
B: Cool! White Flag! White Flag!
K: No War!
B: No Guns!
K: No Corps!
B: Just life.
K: Just Love
B: No Hate.
K: Just fun.
B: No ties.
K: Just me and my mind.
B: Just me and my wife.
K: But tell me if I'm dreamin'
'cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
B: and I don't wanna be left sleepin'
from all the diseases
that I breathe in.
K: Look, respect the island, no stealin'!
B: and don't bring religion here, no three kings.
K: It's great and we ain't leavin'!
We come on in peace. Sing!
B: White flag?
K: White flag!
