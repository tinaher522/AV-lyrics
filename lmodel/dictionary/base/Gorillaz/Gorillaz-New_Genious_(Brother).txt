<song artist="Gorillaz" title="New_Genious_(Brother)">
Dream of my world.
I live on my world.
Going off my head, down to, somewhere.
I'm going on a dance all tune.
I'm in a pressure today.
I blew a bad man away, today.
Higher ground, had to be told.
I blew a man away.
Brother sister too.
Do what you must do.
Don't trust people you meet.
They may promise you,
that the river ain't deep.
Dream of a street.
People passing through me,yes they do.
Want my friend,
want my heart mend.
I'm going to bring it all back to you.
Brother sister too.
Do what you must do.
Don't trust people you meet.
They may promise you,
that the river ain't deep.
