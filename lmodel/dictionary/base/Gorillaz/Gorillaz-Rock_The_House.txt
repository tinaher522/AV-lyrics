<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Rock_The_House">
I know you like that
You wanna try that
It's like a flashback
So shake your ass crack
I got the balls ta
Rock the salsa
Funk the blues-a
Any groove ta
Make you move cause
Taking you ta
Another landscape
Is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposing
So if your feet is frozen I'm a dive to see you ropin'
And when the M.C. rhyme and the D.J. spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now when the M.C. rhymin' and the D.J. cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down
Now when the M.C. rhyme and the D.J. spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now when the M.C. rhymin' and the D.J. cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down
Tap your toes and clap ya hands (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake ya pants (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Gravitational pull
I have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man, and more
Party down with vigor and candor
Come in to the jam
Or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie
Win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy
Seeing all the treasure and the booty
And when the M.C. rhyme and the D.J. spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now when the M.C. rhymin' and the D.J. cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down
And when the M.C. rhyme and the D.J. spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now when the M.C. rhymin' and the D.J. cuttin'
I want y'all to just get down
Tap your toes and clap ya hands (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake ya pants (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes (How many people ready to rock the house?)
I wanna get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearin' Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparin' answers
Sharing transcripts while we over here
Dipping and dancin'
Rhythm romancin'
Wallflowers
Giving no action no
All hours we chillin' and max the flow
Relaxing
Opposites attractin'
I'm-a toss my hat in
Lost when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend
Jiggling and wiggling
Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn
Negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respond
Tap your toes and clap ya hands (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake ya pants (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes (How many people ready to rock the house?)
