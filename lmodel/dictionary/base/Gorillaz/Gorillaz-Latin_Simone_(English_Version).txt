<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Latin_Simone_(English_Version)">
Get up
If you wanna survive
Get oh so alive
In your life everything
Falling out the sky on top of you
Now what you do
Set yourself up now
It's the love of your life
Shead a lead on me
All I know before it's gone
I always feel it's getting me down
When nothings wrong
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me, me, me
Give up
If you wanna survive
Pick the sun back up
You got to get on the song, lowly
What's the point
It's funny till your left to kill yourself
In this town
So what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me
What's the matter with me
What's the matter with me, me, me
