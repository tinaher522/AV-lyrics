<song artist="Gorillaz" title="El_Mannana">
Summer don't know me no more
he just let me go
tiresome.
Summer don't know me
He just left me low in my soul
But I too know love,
from you that's
Just dying
I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
Don't stop the sun when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years gone and now
You'll flee
If you do that
I'll be strong

To find you
I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
