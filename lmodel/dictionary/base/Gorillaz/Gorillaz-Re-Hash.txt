<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Re-Hash">
It's a sweet sensation, over the dock
Oh, what a situation, but don't want to stop
It's the drugstore soul boy, over the dock
With the sweetest inspiration, but don't want to stop
'Cause it's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's a sweet sensation, over the dock
Oh, what a situation, but don't want to stop
It's the drugstore soul boy, over the dock
With the sweetest inspiration, but don't want to stop
'Cause it's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
It's the money or stuff
