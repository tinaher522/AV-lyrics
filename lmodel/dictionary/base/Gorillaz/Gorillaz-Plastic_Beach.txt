<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Plastic_Beach">
To the dark dark seas
Comes the only whale
Watching ships go by
Is the day we try
It doesn't know
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio
Did they haul you out
On a really hot day
When the call got made
You've gone away
(It doesn't know)
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio
(Plastico, plastico, plastico, green, green world)
(Plastico, plastico, plastico, green, green world)
(Plastico, plastico, plastico)
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio
