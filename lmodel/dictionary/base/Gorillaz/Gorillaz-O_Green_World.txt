<song artist="Gorillaz" title="O_Green_World">
O Green World,
Don't desert me now
Bring me back to fallen town
Where someone is still alive
Fighting for something new in this
When no one needs the heart of me and I'll
Get out somewhere other than me before...
(than me before...)
O Green World
Don't desert me now
I'm made of you and you of me
But where are we?
Oh no
Sells to lie
from the darkest stars
Suppose you
Down when you're in fast
Cause it seems so little to you
But I know you now, I know
You know, me too
You know, me too
I hope sex and drugs rust into my self
Holy, it feels, holy
It feels like you're with your father in the place you love...
