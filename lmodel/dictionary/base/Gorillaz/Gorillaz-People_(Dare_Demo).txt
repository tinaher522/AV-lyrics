<song artist="Gorillaz" title="People_(Dare_Demo)">
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground, oh yeah
If you dream through the top
You'll be over the edge
If you get in wrong side
You'll be taking a pitch
You'll be loving a lot
But you don't know why
It's the time of the day
So we're never inside
Your heart isn't there
So you might as well sing
I know it, I got it
But I know that time will set me together
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground, oh yeah
If you dream through the top
You'll be over the edge
If you get in wrong side
You'll be taking a pitch
You'll be loving a lot
But you don't know why
It's the time of the day
So we're never inside
Your heart isn't there
So you might as well sing
I know it, I got it
But I know that time will set me together
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground, oh yeah
