<song artist="Gorillaz" title="19-2000_(Soulchild_Remix)">
It's the music that we choose.
It's the music that we choose.
It's the music that we choose.
It's the music that we choose.
It's the music that we choose.
It's the music that we choose.
It's the music that we choose.
It's the music that we choose.
The world is spinning too fast,
I'm buyin' lead Nike shoes,
To keep myself tethered,
To the days I've tried to lose.
My mama said to slow down,
You must make your own shoes.
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood.
Keep a mild groove on...
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
Keepin' my groove on
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump.
Here you go!
Get the cool!

There's a monkey in the jungle,
Watching a vapor trail,
Caught up in the conflict,
Between his brain and his tail.
And if time's a limitation,
Then we've got nothin' to lose.
Please repeat the message:
It's the music that we choose.
Keep a mild groove on...
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
Keepin' my groove on
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump,
It's the music that we choose
They do the bump.
It's the music that we choose
OK, bring it down, yeah, we gonna break out.
