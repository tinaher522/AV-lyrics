<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Stylo">
Love electricity, shock-wave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload
Legendary, heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder-roll, keep this on
Yes the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming to the
Old stylo (juice)
Go for blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles, its death throe)
Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)
If it's love, it'll be electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now
Sing yourself out of depression (juice)
Rise above all recession
If I know your heart
Electric is the love
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through 
Man or woman
In another world
In another world in the universe
Right now
Here's what we've got to do
If it's love, it'll be electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming on to the
That's what I'm talking about
Love electricity, shock-wave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload
Legendary, heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out
Right now
