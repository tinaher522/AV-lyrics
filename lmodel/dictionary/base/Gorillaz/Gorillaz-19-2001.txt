<song artist="Gorillaz" title="19-2001">
The world is spinnin too fast 
I'm buyin lead nike shoes to keep myself tethered 
to the days i tried to lose 
Hey Ya my mama said to slow down 
you must make your own shoes 
stop dancin to the music of Gorillaz in a happy mood 
Keep A mild groove on 
day doo dee bop 
day do dee bop 
There you go! 
get the cool 
get the cool shoeshine 
get the cool 
get the cool shoeshine 
get the cool 
get the cool shoeshine 
get the cool 

get the cool shoeshine 
There's a monkey in the jungle watchin a vapour trail 
caught up in the conflict between his brain and his tail
And if times elimination then we have nothin to lose 
please repeat the message its the music that we choose 
Keep a mild groove on 
OK were goin to get down then break out 
get the cool 
get the cool shoeshine 
get the cool 
get the cool shoeshine 
get the cool 
get the cool shoeshine 
Day Doo Dee Bop Day Doo Dee Bop Day Doo Dee Bop
