Hello, hello
Is anyone there? Hello
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello, hello
Is anyone there? Hello
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello, is anyone there?
M1A1, thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz got the bass drum
Gorillaz say I want some, some
La la la la la la la la la, hey
La la la la la la la la la, hey
La la la la la la la la la, hey
La la la la la la la la la, oh
M1A1, thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz with the beat, y'all
So in went the seller
We go, M1A1
It's a thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz with the bass drum
Keep that sound
Wake it up [Incomprehensible] 02:47
D'ya hear that? I said M1A1
(La la la la la la la la la, hey)
(La la la la la la la la la, hey)
(La la la la la la la la la, hey)
(La la la la la la la la la, oh)
Hello
