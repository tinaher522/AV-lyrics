<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Man_Research_(Clapper)">
This is the breakfast club.
Bring me coffee in the know.
See the tofu on the sun.
Like a sunshine, I got you.
Nothing, nothing I can do.
Bring me junkie in the love.
He said a nothing in the tounge.
To kill the model from my door
To kill the model, from my door.
To kill the model from my door.
To kill the model from my door.
From my door.
From my door.
