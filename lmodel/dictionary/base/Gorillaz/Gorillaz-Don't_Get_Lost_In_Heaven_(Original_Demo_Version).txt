<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Don't_Get_Lost_In_Heaven_(Original_Demo_Version)">
Got off a plane to the countryside,
I drove to the mountain and holding the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead,
and fire coming out of the monkey's head
[Chorus:]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
you'll make a big mistake
Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line but I wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you had left me,you don't know my soul...
You're a whole bad mistake,yeah,you're a whole one...
[Chorus]
Aaaah...
