[Del] 
Whoa.. Hey let me ask my man over here! 
Hey man let me ask you a question man and c if you know what's up! 
Beat this! 
Who fuses the music 
With no illusions 
Producing the blue prints 
Clueless? 
Automator - defy the laws of nature 
Electronic monolith throw a jam upon the disc 
The futuristic looper with the quickness 
Hyper-producin' hydrogen fusion liquids keep your distance 
First we coerce your brain patterns 
Collaborate with time-consumin' re-programin' 
I apply the flow cannon, the combo so slamin 
Automically reconstruct the old canvas 
His logic impress, a hypnotic effect 
Ya latin patent you could call it a gift 
Man he all in the mix nuclear physicist 
Geneticlly taylored every bit of this stimulus 
Psyonically bionically forget how you feel 
Especially formulated the rest of you fornicated 
It takes more to make this 
He juggles variables 
Unparreled propulsion to carry the load 
Nueral surgeon the purest virgin conducting currents 
Musical merlin he shines like sterling 
Watch the Automator draw laser of a higher intensity 
And instantly miss a beat create a symphony 
Hey I know now, I know now repeat 
Automator's on the planet earth 
And he's gonna stop the war of the worlds 
Deltron Zero is here as well take the cut for real 
He told y'all evil do'ers he is 
Truly gifted in the matters of rhythm 
Ya you got to give him that 
In his infnite wisdom you know you got to get with him 
How's that?.,, How's that?... How did i do? is it cool? (good job!) 
Was it really? (all is well with the cosmos) yhes, yes .. i've got the purge of.. 
D.L. 3030,, yhea .. YHEA!
