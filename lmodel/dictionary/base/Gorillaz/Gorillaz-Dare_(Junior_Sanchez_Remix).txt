It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's there
It's there
You've got to press it on you
You just a-think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
And Work it out
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's there
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's there
It's there
You've got to press it on you
You just a-think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
And Work it out
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's there
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's there
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's there
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's there
You've got to press it on you
You just a-think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
And Work it out
You've got to press it on you
You just a-think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
And Work it out
