<song artist="Gorillaz" title="The_Joplin_Spider">
Colourful sailors washed up on the shore
Caught up on bad times
Spider in the ditch she saw it all
Went to train, ride to dance.
Colourful sailors washed up on the shore
Met up on violence.
Spider in the ditch, she saw it all.
World has fall on bad times.
