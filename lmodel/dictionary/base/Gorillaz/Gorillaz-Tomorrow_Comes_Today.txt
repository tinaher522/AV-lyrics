<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Tomorrow_Comes_Today">
Everybody's here with me
Ain't got no camera to see
Don't think I'm all in this world
The camera won't let me go
The burden doesn't love our soul
The digital won't let me go
Yeah yeah yeah, I'll pay (Yeah, yeah)
When tomorrow, tomorrow comes today
Stereo, I want it on
It's taken me far too long
Don't think I'm all in this world
I don't think I'll be here too long
I don't think I'll be here too long
I don't think I'll be here too long
Yeah yeah yeah, I'll pay
When tomorrow, tomorrow comes today
Yeah, yeah
[Vocalizing, whistling]
