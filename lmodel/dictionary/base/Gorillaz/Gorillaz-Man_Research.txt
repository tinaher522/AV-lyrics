This is the breakfast club!
Bring me coffe,
Bring it now.
I see the taffe
All the same.
I got sunshine
I've got you
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Nothing ever I can do
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La la la la la la la
Bring me java,
Bring it now.
City life can be
Rather dumb.
To kill the model from my door
He has killed the model from my door.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La la la la la la la
He has killed the model from my door,
oh, yeah.
He has killed the model from my door.
From my door.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La la la la la la la
