<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Slow_Country">
City life.
Calling me all the time
And my soul
Geared to attack
Never get a better chance
So what you doing?
Gotta get money,
Ain't quite what you're doing.
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness...
Should not lie,
I'm tryin' not to laugh though,
You won't get money
from doing what you're lovin'
I'm moving out of city
Victor of a second chance,
Get a lot of problems,
Gotta (get) rid of 'em
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness...
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Laaa lalalala laaa la la la la
Mmm mmm...
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness...
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness,
Na na na na, loneliness...
