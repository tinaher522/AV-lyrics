<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Hillbilly_Man">
Drive away, 
As in lonesome sound,
Like a real straight shooter,
Three lanes full,
Drive away,
As it lonesome sounds,
Like a real straight shooter,
Three lanes full,
Gotta ride in my heart,
Get 'em goin' down,
You don't have to be a start,
To, to get them goin' 'round 
Even if you try to move,
Wheel it to your right,
So get on, on the driving wheel,
Save it for a round, 
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man x4
Got to ride in my heart,
See 'em goin' down
Killed up by the ball front,
Shoot a jamboree,
Just a cold 'nother day,
Like a memory,
Just a cold 'nother day,
Slip a line on me,
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy manx4
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man x4
