This is the Breakfast Club
Bring me coffee in the know
See the taffy on the send
I got sunshine, I got you
Their's nothing, nothing life can do
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Bring me junk in the know
He said nothing in the tongue
To kill the model from my door, oh yeah
To kill the model, from my door
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
To kill the model from my door
Just to kill the model from my door
From my door
From my door
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
