<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Don't_Get_Lost_In_Heaven">
Got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead
And fire coming out of a monkey's head
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake
Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line but I wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you had left me, you don't know my soul...
You're a whore, yeah, you're a who-ore...
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake
Aaaah
You'll make a big mistake
Aaaah
You'll make a big mistake
Aaaah
You'll make a big mistake
Aaaah...
