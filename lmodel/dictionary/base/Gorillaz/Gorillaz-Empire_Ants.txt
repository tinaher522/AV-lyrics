<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Empire_Ants">
Oh joys are us
The sun has come again
To hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here
It’s all around you
It’s all around you out here
And if the whole world is crashing
Down on you
Fall through space out of mind
With me
Where the emptiness we leave behind on 
Warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire is here
To hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps
Little memories marching on
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin will it soar
My little dreams working the machine
Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're
Going on
Little memories your little feet working
The machine
Say will it spin will it soar
My little dreams working the machine
Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're
Going on
