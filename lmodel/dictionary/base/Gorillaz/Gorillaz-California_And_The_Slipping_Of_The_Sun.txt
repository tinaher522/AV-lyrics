<song artist="Gorillaz" title="California_And_The_Slipping_Of_The_Sun">
California                         
An ocean now I come again before you
All alone with you
In the slipping of the sun
Set on dreamers                          
Repeats the faithful ones again
Like water of the mountains that       
It's the slipping of the sun...
