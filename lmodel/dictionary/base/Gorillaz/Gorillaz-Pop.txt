<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Pop">
Said to myself I'll go up
Makeup for myself, I'll never.
Always thought a fire starter.
Then everybody tell you shit.
Back to this town,
doing what you can.
Bound to be gone,
Damn a loser.
Damn it but I'll never give up.
But everybody said shit.
Yeah!
Damn she might care to love up.
Then say she'll never get up.
Everybody said to shit up.
Last time I tell them word up.
Down in the sun,
I did what I was told.
Did it to my self,
Did it to my self.
And don't expect anything else.
Cause everybody tell me shit.
