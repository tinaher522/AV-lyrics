<song artist="Gorillaz" title="On_Melancholy_Hill">
Up on Melancholy Hill
There's a plastic tree.
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day
Of another dream,
Where you can't get what you want
But you can get me.
So let's set out to sea
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me,
When you're close to me.
So call in the submarines
'Round the world we'll go.
Does anybody know her?
If we're looking out on the day
Of another dream.
If you can't get what you want
Then come with me.
Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits a manatee, love.
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me,
When you're close to me...
...When you're close to me.
