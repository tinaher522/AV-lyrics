<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Crystalised">
You've applied the pressure
To have me crystalised
And you've got the faith
That I could bring paradise
I forgive and forget
Before I'm paralyzed
Do I have to keep up this pace
To keep you satisfied
(Ahh ahh ahh) (x4)
You don't move slow
Taking steps in my direction
The sound resounds, echoes
Does it lessen your affection
No
(Ahh ahh ahh) (x4)
You say I'm foolish
For pushing this aside
But don't burn down our home
I won’t leave alive
Glaciers have melted to the sea
I wish the tide would take me over
I’ve been down on my knees
And you just keep on getting closer
(Ahh ahh ahh) (x8)
