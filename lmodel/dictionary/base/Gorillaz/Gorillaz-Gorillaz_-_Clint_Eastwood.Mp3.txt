I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
Yeah, ha, finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothing 'cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare
Intangible, I bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews
Chicks and dudes who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual, hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view when you're too crazy
Lifeless, to know the definition for what life is
Priceless, for you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those, possess you with one go
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
The essence, the basics, without it you make it
Allow me to make this child like in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree, every child apiece
Every cloud you see, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind, that's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so mother fuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head
Hey I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
