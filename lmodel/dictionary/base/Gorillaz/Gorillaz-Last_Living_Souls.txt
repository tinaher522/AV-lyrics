<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Last_Living_Souls">
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Take a gun
Or how you say
That's no way you behave
You're just alone, when you begin
To sing a song that doesn't sing
It grows, you know
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last to get away to some another day
Do we know
Well, we know
Doesn't seem to be complete
Are we, are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Get up, get up, get up, get up...
What you say
Cause all I was on
I got it down wrong I see myself to get
And the Lord, seeing all now
Can you take us in the part that coming on
The coldest man doesn't see it's all
We go to the car I see you walk to the far
And when you get there do you see
You fit the last you need on me
Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
