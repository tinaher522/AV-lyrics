<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Dare_(Soulwax_Remix)">
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out
You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down there
It's DARE
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's DARE
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's DARE
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out
You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out
You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down there
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's DARE
