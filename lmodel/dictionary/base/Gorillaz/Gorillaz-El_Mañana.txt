<song artist="Gorillaz" title="El_MaÃ±ana">
Summer don't know me no more
He got mad, tiresome.
Summer don't know me
He just left me low in my self
'Cause I too know love,
from you that
Just died. Yeah.
I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years past and now
You'll flee
If you do that
I'll be strong
To find you
I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
