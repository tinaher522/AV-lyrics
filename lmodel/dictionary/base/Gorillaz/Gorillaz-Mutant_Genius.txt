<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Mutant_Genius">
Yeah
Dream On My World
I Live On My World 
Going Off My Head, Down To, Somewhere 
I' M Going On A Dancehall Tune 
In A Pressure Today
I Blew A Bad Man Away, Today
Higher Ground, Had To Be Told 
I Blew A Man Away 
Brother, Sister Too
Do What You Must Do
Don't Trust People You Meet
Yeah, Yeah
They Might Promise You That The River Ain't Deep 
Dream On The Street
People Passing Through Me, Yes They Do
Well My Friend
Want My Heart Mend
I'm Gonna Bring It All Back To You 
Brother, Sister Too
Do What You Must Do
Don't Trust People You Meet
Yeah, Yeah
They Might Promise You That The River Ain't Deep 
Brother, Sister Too
Do What You Must Do
Don't Trust People You Meet
Yeah, Yeah
They Might Promise You That The River Ain't Deep 
Brother, Sister Too
Do What You Want To Do
Now That I, That's Right
The River And People Seem To Die
And Keep On To This, Keep On
The River Ain't Deep, The River Ain't Deep, The River Ain't Deep
