<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Rockin'_Santas_House">
I know you like that
You wanna try that
Its like a flashback
So shake your a** crack
I got the balls to
Rock the salsa
Funk the blues-a
Any groove to
Make you move cos
Taking you to
Another landscape
Its my mandate
Im highly animated even though Im decomposing
So if your feet is frozen im a die to see you ropin?
And when the mc rhyme and the dj spin
I want yall to just get down
Now when the mc rhyme and the dj spin
I want yall to just get down
And when the mc rhyme and the dj spin
I want yall to just get down
Now when the mc rhyme and the dj spin
I want yall to just get down
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Graviational pull
I have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins running man and more
Party down with vigga and candor
Coming to the jam
Or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie
Win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a gucci wallet turntables is talking to me
Its awfully groovy
Seeing all the treasure and the booty
And when the mc rhyme and the dj spin
I want yall to just get down
Now when the mc rhymin and the dj cuttin
I want yall to just get down
And when the mc rhyme and the dj spin
I want yall to just get down
Now when the mc rhymin and the dj cuttin
I want yall to just get down
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(how many people ready to rock the house )
I wanna get down lower than atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funky weve been funkadelic wearin pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparin answers
Sharing transcripts while we over here
Dipping and dancin
Rhythm romancin
Wallflowers
Giving no action no
All hours we chillin and max the flow
Relaxing
Opposites attracting
Im a toss my hat in
Floss when the track spin
Like Im on a crack bend
Jigging and wiggling
Frigen booties speakin to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
Youll feel reborn
Negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respawns
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(how many people ready to rock the house )
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(how many people ready to rock the house )
