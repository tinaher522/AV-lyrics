<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Bobby_In_Phoenix">
Let's talk about feelings
It's got a way to helpin you to breathe a little better
Mmmmmhmmmm
With a stormin rain
If you need to escape
Wooah
Ooh you wonder why
Let's talk about feelings
It's got a way to helpin you to breathe a little better
Ooooh
Yaaa hm
I can slowly see(feel?)
Life fading away
In my mind in my heart i have no doubt
Ooooh
You wonder why
