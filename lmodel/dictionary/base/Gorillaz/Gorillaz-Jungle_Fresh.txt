<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Jungle_Fresh">
The World Is Spinning Too Fast
I'm Buying Lead Nike Shoes
To Keep Myself Tethered
To The Days I've Tried To Lose 
My Mama Said To Slow Down
You Must Make Your Shoes
Stop Dancing To The Music
Of Gorillaz In A Happy Mood 
Keep A Mild Groove On 
Here You Go!
Get The Cool
Get The Cool Shoe Shine
Get The Cool
Get The Cool Shoe Shine 
There's A Monkey In The Jungle
Watching A Vapour Trail
Caught Up In The Conflict
Between His Brain And His Tail 
And If Time To Elimination
Then We Got Nothing To Lose
Please Repeat The Message
It's The Music That We Choose 
Keep A Mild Groove On 
Get The Cool
Get The Cool Shoe Shine
Get The Cool
Get The Cool Shoe Shine 
Here You Go!
