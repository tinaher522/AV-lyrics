<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Rhinestone_Eyes">
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like
Factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep with 
Future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising
For this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet while rain is falling like 
Rhinestones from the sky
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable yet
Clinging to the Adams of rock
Seasons the adjustments signs of change
I can't see now, she said taxi
Now red light is all I can see
This storm brings strange loyalties, and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
(That's electric)
Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day same routine
Clear target in summer 
When skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
