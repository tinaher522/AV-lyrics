If you have any checked bags 
They will be brought to the front of the station
 To get to the front, walk 
Down to the south end of the platform 
And cross at the crosswalk  
That'll put you right in front of the depot 
Look for a sign that says 'Baggage Claim'  
You should have your bag check handy to show the clerk 
Give them a few minutes to get your bags to the front 
If anyone is in need of a ride to the front of the station 
Red Cap service will be provided on the platform
  We do have one group that is going to go first
 If you do need Red Cap service to arrive at the front 
They will come back and pick you up on the platform 
And take you to the front of the station 
Taxi cabs are located on the center boulevard in front of the depot  
California 
Oh ocean, now I come again before you 
Rode along with you 
In the slipping of the sun  
Sun on dreamers
 Repeat the faithful once again
 Like water on the mountains and 
It's the slipping of the sun  
Money is pouring 
Three days to go 
This autumn begins to focus 
North claims the imperial 
[Incomprehensible] 
totem  
Fantastic 
Trees, 
lakes 
Mountains 
Fantastic
