<song artist="Gorillaz" title="Shoe_Shine_Remix">
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose (dayay it's the)
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
to keep myself teathered 
to the days I tried to lose (dayay it's the)
My momma said to slow down
to keep my speaker off the shoes
stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood (dayay it's the)
Keepin' my groove on
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (It's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (It's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (It's the music that we choose) (dayay it's the)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose) (Here you go)
Get the cool (na-nana-na na na)
Get the cool shoe shine (na-nana-na)
Get the cool (na-nana-na na na)
get the cool shoe shine (na-nana-na)
get the cool (na-nana-na na na)
get the cool shoe shine (na-nana-na)
get the cool (na-nana-na na na)
get the cool shoe shine (na-nana-na)
There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
between his brain and his tail (dayay it's the)
And If it's time's elimination
We've got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose (dayay it's the)
Keep a mild groove on
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (It's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (It's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (It's the music that we choose) (dayay it's the)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
(it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (na-nana-na na na)
Get the cool shoe shine (na-nana-na)
Get the cool (na-nana-na na na)
get the cool shoe shine (na-nana-na)
get the cool (na-nana-na na na)
get the cool shoe shine (na-nana-na)
