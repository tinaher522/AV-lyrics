<song artist="Gorillaz" title="New_Genious_Brother">
Dream of my world
I live on my world
Going off my head down to, somewhere
I'm going on a dance all tune
I'm in a pressure today
I blew a bad man away, today
Higher ground, had to be told
I blew a man away
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet
They may promise you
That the river ain't deep
Dream of a street
People passing through me, yes they do
Want my friend
Want my heart mend
I'm going to bring it all back
Brother sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet
They may promise you
That the river ain't deep
