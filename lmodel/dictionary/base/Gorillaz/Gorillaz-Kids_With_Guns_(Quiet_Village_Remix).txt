Kids with guns, kids with guns
Taking over but it won't be long
They mesmerized, skeletons
Kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to
Drinking out
(Push it real, push it)
Pacifier
(Push it real, push it)
Vitamin souls
(Push it real, push it)
The street desire
(Push it real, push it)
Doesn't make sense to
(Push it real, push it)
But it won't be long
(Push it real, push it)
Kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to
And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire, it's all desire
Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking soul
Where you are
Doesn't make sense to
But it won't be long
'Cause kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to
And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire, turning us into monsters
It's all desire, it's all desire, it's all desire
Push it real, push it, push it
Push it real, push it, push it
Push it real, push it, push it
Push it real, push it, push it
Push it real, push it, push it
Push it, push it real, push it
