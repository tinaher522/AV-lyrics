<song artist="U2" title="Yahweh_(Alternative_Version)">
Take these shoes 
Click clacking down some dead end street 
Take these shoes 
And make them fit 
Take this shirt 
Polyester white trash made in nowhere 
Take this shirt 
And make it clean 
Take this soul 
Stranded in some skin and bones 
Take this soul 
And make it sing 
Yahweh, Yahweh 
Always pain before a child is born 
Yahweh, Yahweh 
Still I'm waiting for the dawn 
Take these hands 
And teach them what to carry 
Take these hands 
Don't make a fist, no 
Take this mouth 
So quick to criticise 
Take this mouth 
Give it a kiss 
Yahweh, Yahweh 
Always the pain before the child is born 
Yahweh, Yahweh 
Still I'm waiting for the dawn 
I'm still waiting 
I'm still waiting for the dawn 
Take these blue eyes 
Take these blue eyes 
Take these eyes and make them see 
Love is just a drop in the ocean 
This love is just a drop in the ocean 
Love is just a drop in the ocean 
Yahweh, Yahweh 
Always pain before a child is born 
Yahweh, you're waiting for me 
Still I'm waiting for the dawn 
Take this city 
A city should be shining on a hill 
Take this city 
If it be your will 
What no man can own, no man can take 
Take this heart 
Take this heart 
Take this heart 
And make it break
