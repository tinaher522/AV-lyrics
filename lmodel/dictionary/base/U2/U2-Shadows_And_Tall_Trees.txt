<song artist="U2" title="Shadows_And_Tall_Trees">
Back to the cold restless streets at night
Talk to myself about tomorrow night.
Walls of white protest
A gravestone in name
Who is it now?
It's always the same.
Who is it now? Who calls me inside?
Are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.
Life through a window
A discoloured pain
Mrs Brown's washing is always the same
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.
Do you feel in me
Anything redeeming
Any worthwhile feeling?
This love is like a tightrope
Hanging from my ceiling?
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.
