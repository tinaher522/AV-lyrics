<song artist="U2" title="Slow_Dancing">
My love is cruel as the night 
She steals the sun, and shuts out the light 
All of my colors, they turn to blue 
Win or lose 
She does it slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She does it slow...dancing 
All night long 
Scarlet eyes and a see-through heart 
She saw me coming right from the start 
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees 
Just a' beggin' her, beggin' her please 
Take me slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She took me slow...dancing 
All night long 
And I don't know a man 
Search for himself in his lover's eyes 
No I don't know why a man 
Sees the truth but needs the lies 
My love is restless as the wind 
She moves like a shadow across my skin 
She left with my conscience, I don't want it back 
It just gets in the way 
If you wanna go slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She took me slow...dancing 
All night long 
Slow...dancing 
Slow...dancing 
Slow...
