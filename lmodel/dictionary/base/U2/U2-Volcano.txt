<song artist="U2" title="Volcano">
The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin’ to hold on
To what you used to be
I’m so glad the past is gone
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you don’t see so well
The future’s gonna land on you
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano
You were alone
And now you’re not alone
You were alone
But you are rock n’ roll
You and I are rock n’ roll
But you are rock n’ roll
You and I are rock n’ roll
Oh, volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano
