<song artist="U2" title="Tryin'_To_Throw_Your_Arms_Around_The_World">
Six o'clock in the morning
You're the last to hear the warning
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
You been falling off the sidewalk
Your lips move but you can't talk
Tryin' to throw your arms around the world
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Be still
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman I will
Sunrise like a nosebleed
Your head hurts and you can't breathe
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
How far are you gonna go
Before you lose your way back home
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Be still
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman I will
Yeah, I dreamed that I saw Dali
With a supermarket trolley
He was tryin' to throw his arms around a girl
He took an open top beetle
Through the eye of a needle
He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman be still
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman I will
Nothing much to say, I guess
Just the same as all the rest
Been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
And a woman needs a man
Like a fish needs a bicycle
When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman be still, woman be still
Be still, woman be still
Woman I will
