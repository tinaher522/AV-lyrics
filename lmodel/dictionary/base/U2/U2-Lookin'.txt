<song artist="U2" title="Lookin'">
One man's junk is another man's treasure.
The object you seek is in a place where you might find pleasure.
It's so easy to find. . .it's right under your nose!
Basically, it's around some garden hose.
You've been led here, &amp; you've been led there,
But the pleasure is where I say it is, I swear!
You look too hard; harder than it is!
If you'd just use your brain, I'd call the Wiz!
We play with you - we need closure to die.
It's almost like eating a piece of humble pie!
So we'll keep playing until you open your eyes.
When you're close to the truth, we won't tell you no lies!
One man's junk is another man's treasure.
The object you seek is in a place where you find pleasure.
Oh, it's in a place where you find pleasure.
