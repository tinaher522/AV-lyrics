<song artist="U2" title="Native_Son">
Yeah its on the street 
It's under your feet 
It's everywhere 
But if you're looking for free 
Don't look at me 
My enemy became my country 
On the run, officer put down the gun 
Native son, I never wanted to own one 
Native son, both of us want to be someone 
It's so hard, is it so hard for a native son 
To be free? 
Tears fallen from the sky 
Fallen to the ground 
Bullets start to fly 
He's hurt, he's in the dirt 
On my word 
I did not take his life 
Don't want to run away 
This isn't in my father's plans 
I know I can't stay 
If I stay I know what's next 
On the run, officer put down the gun 
Native son, I never wanted to own one 
Native son, all of us want to be someone 
It's so hard, is it so hard for a native son 
To be free? 
Free 
Yeah yeah yea-yeah 
Yeah yeah yea-yea-yeah 
Yeah yeah yea-yea-yea-yeah 
Free 
On the run, officer put down the gun 
Native son, I never wanted to own one 
Native son, both of us want to be someone 
It's so hard, is it so hard for a native son 
To be free? 
Free 
Free 
Yeah
