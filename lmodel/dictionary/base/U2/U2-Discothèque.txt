<song artist="U2" title="DiscothÃ¨que">
You can reach
But you can't grab it
You can hold it, control it
But you can't bag it
You can push
But you can't direct it
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You cannot connect it
You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie dovie stuff
You get confused
But you know it
Yeah, you hurt for it, work for it, love
You don't always show it
Let go, let's go, let's go
To the discotheque
Let go, let go
To the discotheque
You're looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You want to be the song
Be the song that you hear in your head
It's not a trick
'Cause you can't learn it
It's the way you don't pay, that's okay
'Cause you can't earn it
You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie dovie stuff
Let go, let go
To the discotheque
Go girl, go girl
To the discotheque
You're looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You want to be the song
Be the song that you hear in your head
You want heaven in your heart
Heaven in your heart
The sun, the moon, and the stars
But you take what you can get
'Cause it's all that you can find
But you know there's something more
But tonight, tonight, tonight
To the discotheque...
