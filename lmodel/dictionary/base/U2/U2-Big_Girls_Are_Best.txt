Ow, Ow, Oww 
Ow, Ow, Oww 
Baby 
As long as the night is colored blue and black 
Oh, yeah yeah yeah 
As long as you're on your knees and she's not on her back 
Oh, yeah yeah yeah 
Avenue Atlantico, 1702 
She's coco butter, baby, she's the glue 
She's got the baby at her breast 
She knows big girls are best 
(We sing it) 
(Uh huh, we go) 
Mama mama mama 
Mama mama mama 
Mama mama mama 
I'm gonna change like the weather, hot to cold 
Oh, yeah yeah yeah 
She's keeps it all together, she's got the motherlode 
Oh, yeah yeah yeah 
She feels it, every sensation 
She's got a smile like salvation 
She's got a baby at her breast 
She knows big girls are best 
Oh Oh

Sexy mama mom say mama ma 
(Coming today) 
Say mama mom say mama ma 
Say mama mama mama mama ma 
Lovely 
She's elliptical, extra political 
Oh so spiritual, not superficial 
Yeah, she's tropical 
Yes, she's illogical 
Those little girls are a pest 
Big girls are the best 
Ow, ow oww 
Ow, ow oww 
Baby 
As long as the night is colored blue and black 
Oh, yeah yeah yeah 
As long as you're on your knees and she's not on her back 
Oh, yeah yeah yeah 
She can taste every sensation 
She's got a smile like salvation 
She's got a baby, a baby at her breast 
She walk like she talk... big girls are best 
Big girls 
Mama mama mama mama 
Sexy mama mama ma ma ma 
Sexy mama mama ma ma ma 
Sexy mama mama ma ma ma 
(Hey boy!) 
Sexy ma ma ma ma ma ma
