<song artist="U2" title="Highway_Of_Loneliness">
It's 2 am her body laid cold, mind fighting demons 
Screaming her last breath to be rescued 
But in her dreams she is a lonely broken soul
No one is looking deep in enough to see 
How desperate she is begging for eyes compassion 
She screams once again only to hear her own echo. 
Chorus
Day after day, 
So many people going the same direction
No where to exit no where to stop 
For the broken heart and soul 
This is the highway of loneliness 
In this roller-coaster life he lost his since of pride
But he ain't giving up for some better days
Season has changes better days are late
Eyes toward the sky asking how long will it be 
He is reaching out for a helping hand,
But only his shadow looking his direction
Chorus
Day after day, 
So many people going the same direction
No where to exit no where to stop 
For the broken heart and soul 
This is the highway of loneliness  
They dreamed about this coming day 
Where you and I will see through them 
Reaching with more than words, but with heart 
We are their exist of this highway of loneliness
Can we hear the thousands voices calling for us 
We are their exit of this highway of loneliness.  
Chorus
Day after day, 
So many people going the same direction
No where to exist no where to stop 
For the broken heart and soul 
This is the highway of loneliness
