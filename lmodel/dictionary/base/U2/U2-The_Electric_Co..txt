<song artist="U2" title="The_Electric_Co.">
Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to.
Toy, broken toy
You can shout and shout, 'til you're inside out
But if you don't know.
Electric Co.
If you don't know
Electric co.
Red, running red
You play for real
But the toy can feel
Holding your head
You won't shout
You still beg
If you don't know
The Electric Co.
If you don't know.
Electric co.
If you don't know
Electric co.
