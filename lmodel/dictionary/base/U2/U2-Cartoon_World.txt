<song artist="U2" title="Cartoon_World">
Mr. Burk is off to work
He carries papers in his carrier bag
Mr. Postman takes his bag back
Those angry dogs, those angry dogs
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
Mrs. Brown is off to town
She carries shopping in her shopping bag
Mr. Brown is working hard
For some degree at university
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It really is
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
Uncle Tony hates a drag
He didn't give me a lot of time, dear
Jack and Jill go up the hill
To pick some flowers and daffodils
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon
