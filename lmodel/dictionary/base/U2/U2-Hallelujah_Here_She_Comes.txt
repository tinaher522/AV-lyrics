<song artist="U2" title="Hallelujah_Here_She_Comes">
I see you're dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until
Hallelujah (Hallelujah) here she comes
I see you're dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back
Hallelujah (Hallelujah) here she comes
Born and raised on the wrong side of town
You get so high that you can't come down
Yeah
I see the road is rough
You know I'm not giving up
Hallelujah (Hallelujah) here she comes
I know where the lady goes
I know she got a ring on her toes
Hallelujah (Hallelujah) here she comes
Born and raised on the wrong side of town
You get so high you can't come down
I'm going higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, high on love
Higher, higher, high on love
Higher, higher, high on love
I'm gonna be there
When that light's gonna shine
I'm gonna be there
When her heart kindles next to mine
I'm gonna be
Here she comes
Yeah, here she comes
I see you're dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until
Hallelujah (Hallelujah) here she comes
I see you're dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back
Hallelujah (Hallelujah) here she comes
Born and raised on the wrong side of town
You get so high you can't come down
I'm gonna be there
Higher, higher, high on love
Higher, higher, high on love
Higher, higher, high on love
I'm gonna be there
Higher, higher, high on love
(When that light's gonna shine)
I'm gonna be there
Higher, higher, high on love
(When that light's gonna shine)
Hallelujah here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Oh, here she comes
Here she comes
Oh, here she comes
Here she comes, wooh
Sing it
Higher, higher, high on love
Higher, higher, high on love
