<song artist="U2" title="Stand_Up_Comedy">
Love love love love love...
Love love love love love...
I got to stand up and take a step.
You and I have been asleep for hours.
I got to stand up.  The wire is stretched
In between our two towers.
Stand up in this dizzy world.
Where a lovesick eye can steal the view.
I'm gonna fall down if I can't stand up.
For your love.
Love love love love love...
Stand up, this is comedy.
The DNA lottery may have left you smart.
But can [I] stand up to beauty, dictator of the heart.
I can stand up for hope, faith, love.
But while I'm getting over certainty.
Stop helping God across the road like a little old lady.
Out from under your beds.
C'mon ye people.
Stand up for your love.
Love love love love love...
I gotta stand up to my ego
But my ego's not really the enemy.
It's like a small child crossing an eight lane highway.
On a voyage of discovery.
Stand up to rock stars, Napoleon is in high heels.
Josephine, be careful of small men with big ideas.
Out from under your beds.
C'mon ye people.
Stand up for your love.
Love love love love love...
God is love.
And love is evolution's very best day.
Soul rockin' people moving on.
Soul rockin' people on and on.
C'mon ye people.
We're made of stars.
C'mon ye people.
Stand up then sit down for your love.
Love love love love love...
Love love love love love...
