<song artist="U2" title="Speed_Of_Life">
Gonna push it, wish they got it right
What they call you when you're in life
Ran for an ocean, they running's done
Running for a lady at the speed of life
Of life
My question, at least you got it right
They got you when you're in sight
Running from the ocean on stepping stones
Running from a lady at the speed of life
Of life
On your way inside a mirror turning in here, in his hand
Love's still well if father keeps me home, it really is
I am higher, way up, fall
