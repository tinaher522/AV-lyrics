<song artist="U2" title="A_Room_At_The_Heartbreak_Hotel">
From where I stand
I can see thrugh you
From where you're sitting, pretty one
I know it got to you
I see the stars in your eyes
You want the truth, but you need the lies
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino
You give your life for rock n' roll
Uh huh
Stand, we're on a landslide of love
You got everything you want
But what you need you give away
For primitive love
And a ride on the mistery train
A primitive love
A room at the Heart...
The Heartbreak Hotel
A room at the Heartbreak
Heartbreak Hotel
A room at the Heartbreak
Heartbreak Hotel
You say it's love, it's not the money
You let them suck your life out like honey
Turning tricks, you're on the street
Selling your kisses so bittersweet
A primitive love
A and a ride on the mistery train
A primitive love
A room at the Heart
The Heartbreak Hotel
A room at the Heartbreak, the Heartbreak,
The Heartbreak Hotel, Hotel
