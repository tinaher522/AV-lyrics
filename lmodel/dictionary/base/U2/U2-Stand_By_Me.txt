<song artist="U2" title="Stand_By_Me">
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
