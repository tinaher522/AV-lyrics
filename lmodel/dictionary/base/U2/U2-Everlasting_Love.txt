<song artist="U2" title="Everlasting_Love">
Hearts gone astray
Leaving hurt when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
With deep regret
I come back begging you
Won't you forget
Where's the love we once knew
Yeah
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be lasting part of 
Everlasting love
Need a love to last forever
Need a love to last forever
Hearts gone astray
Leaving hurt when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
Filled with regret
I come back begging you
Won't you forget
Where's the love we once knew
Yeah...
Where life's river flows
No one really knows
'Til someone's there to show
The way to lasting love
Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine
It's eternal love
When other's lovelight's gone
Ours will still be strong
We'll have our very own
Everlasting love
Real love will last forever
Real love will last forever
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my sid
Girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of 
Everlasting love
