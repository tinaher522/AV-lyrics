<song artist="U2" title="Gone">
You get to feel so guilty, you got so much for so little
Then you find that feeling just won't go away
You were holding on to every little thing so tightly
'Til there's nothing left for you anyway
Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the Sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
You wanted to get somewhere so badly
You had to lose yourself along the way
You changed your name, well, that's okay, it's necessary
What you leave behind you don't miss anyway
Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the Sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
'Cause I'm already gone
Felt that way all along
Closer to you every day
I didn't want it that much anyway
You're taking steps that make you feel dizzy
Then you learn to like the way it feels
You hurt yourself, you hurt your lover, then you discover
What you thought was freedom is just greed
Goodbye, and it's an emotional
Goodnight, I'll be up with the Sun
Are you still holding on?
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
Come, Sun, Sun, Sun
Come, Sun, come, Sun
Sun
