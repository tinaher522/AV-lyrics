<song artist="U2" title="Heaven_And_Hell">
Once you get a chance
You come to baby
Right back, you call me down
Used to think you wanted nothing to do
Was to say nothing at all
You went like the one time
A two time
You're back, and me
Drop off the back seat
Of a bad car
Where finders
Came alone
Bono: "f"
Wishing her out of my life
Wishing her...
What am I to do
Came a talk to street
And a time that you listen
Don't you beg the time on me
They said you oughta call her back
I wanna, but afraid to say
I won't hang up on you baby, child
Nothing feels like this before
Here in in my life
Yeah in heaven and hell
Baby you're heaven and hell
Heaven and hell
Bono: "f"
Oh, heaven and hell

All the time...
Want a chance to hold you
Want a chance to kill
I want a chance to keep you awake at night
When the sunlight burns through your love
But you can't always get
Everything you want
You take cards from all under the table
You're heaven, heaven and hell
Baby you're heaven...heaven and hell
Yeah, you're heaven...heaven and hell
Cover me...
Bono: "e!"
Bono: "okay organ. just organ."
Darkness...
You light up my darkness
You light up my darkness
And open up...
Bono: "f"
Bono: "organ."
Bono: "this time when we come in, come in a little bit quietly. not the drums, but everyone else."
Heaven...
