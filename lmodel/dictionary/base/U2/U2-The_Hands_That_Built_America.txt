<song artist="U2" title="The_Hands_That_Built_America">
Oh my love, it's a long way we've come
From the freckled hills to the steel glass canyons
From the stony fields, to hanging steel from the sky
From digging in our pockets for a reason not to say goodbye
These are the hands that built America
(Russian, Sioux, Dutch, Hindu)
Oh, oh oh, America
(Polish, Irish, German, Italian)
Last saw your face in a watercolour sky
As sea birds argue, a long goodbye
I took your kiss, on the spray of the Newline Star
You gotta live with your dreams, don't make them so hard
And these are the hands, that built America
(The Irish, the Blacks, the Chinese, the Jews)
Ah, ah ah, America / Hand
(Korean, Hispanic, Muslim, Indian)
Of all of the promises, is this one we could keep
Of all of the dreams, is this one still out of reach
Out ta outa reeeach
(Dream-oh-yeah)
(Oh oh-dream, oh love)
It's early fall, there's a cloud on the New York skyline
Innocence, dragged across a yellow line
These are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah America
