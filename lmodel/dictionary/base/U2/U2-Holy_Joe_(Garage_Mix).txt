(Yeah)
I...
I'm a humble guy
No, really I try
You know it's hard sometimes
You...
Yeah, you're messed up too
My brother's gonna get through
Working my way to get to you
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me
Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe
Please...
Don't make me say please
Champagne and ice cream
It's not what I want, it's what I need
Devotion
And a little appreciation
Little heavy rotation
Looks good on me
(Having the best time of anybody's life)
(Closer than ever to everybody's wife)
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me
Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe
(Having the best time of anybody's life)
(Closer than ever to everybody's wife)
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Be good to me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me
Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe
Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe
Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe
