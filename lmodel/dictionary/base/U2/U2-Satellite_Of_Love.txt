<song artist="U2" title="Satellite_Of_Love">
Satellite's gone up to the sky 
Things like that drive me out of my mind 
I watched it for a little while 
I love to watch things on TV 
Oh, satellite of love 
Ah, satellite of love 
Ooh, satellite of love 
Satellite 
Satellite's gone way up to Mars 
Soon it will be filled with parking cars 
I watched it for a little while 
I love to watch things on TV 
Ooh, ahh, satellite of love 
Ha, satellite of love 
Satellite of love 
Satellite 
I've been told that you've been bold 
With Harry, Mark and John 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday 
Harry, Mark and John 
Satellite's gone up to the sky 
Things like that drive me out of my mind 
I watched it for a little while 
I love to watch things on TV 
Hoo, satellite of love 
Haa, satellite of love 
Hoo, satellite of love 
Satellite of
Satellite, satellite...
