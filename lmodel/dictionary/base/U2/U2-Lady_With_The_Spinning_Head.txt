<song artist="U2" title="Lady_With_The_Spinning_Head">
Here she comes 
Lady luck again 
Figure of eight 
Six and nine again 
My lady with the spinning head 
Whatever the deal 
She won't let me down 
Wherever I go 
She's always hanging 'round 
My lady with the spinning head 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head 
She's been gone 
But I knew she'd be back 
She's got the rent 
She put me in the black 
The lady with the spinning head 
Took my mind 
Took away my car 
Do you dare to ask 
What I'm talking about 
I'm on top 
When she's around 
She's my ticket 
Out of town 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head
