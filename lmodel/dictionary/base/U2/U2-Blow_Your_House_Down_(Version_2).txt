<song artist="U2" title="Blow_Your_House_Down_(Version_2)">
Tie these shoes
To get the right blues
Get sick, get hit
Be inside this
Be alone, get high
Monkey on the door
Get the city in the shoes
It's burning, come around
Say don't...
Baby, can't miss her dancing
Give in...and journey on
Time is falling
God is getting to it
Get the sun in your eye
Big take, go
Get high, get rope
Won't you get soaked
Get time in your hands
And you pick and start going
She's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
Need you in doubt
And she's...gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
Holy smoke
Got to get go
Get the sun in the fever
God is starting night
Get hip with the switch
Get back into the soon
Got, pretty soon
Gonna take you high
She's...she's gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
How does it feel
When can't keep a second low
How does feel like
When your duke is letting go
Bono: "Bridge."
How does it feel a bridge
When you're going in the bridge
When falling in the bridge
When you're going in the bridge
When you're going in the bridge
Bridge...
Bono: "And chorus!"
She's...gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
She's...gonna blow your house down
She's gonna turn your head around
She's gonna blow your house down
Got to got to got to got to got to
Got to got to got to got to got to
Got to got to got to got to got to
Got to...
Bono: "Do the bridge again."
Bono: "Keep going."
Bono: "Bridge."
Bono: "Into the chorus!"
She's...gonna blow your house down
Take your head around
Take it for a change
Bono: "Again!"
She's...gonna blow your house down
Take your head around
Take you down
Bono: "Chorus!"
She's...gonna blow your house down
Take your head around
Gonna take you down
Go dancing
A dance here
A down and down
Hunt into your pocket, oh yeah
Pocket, bring in down
