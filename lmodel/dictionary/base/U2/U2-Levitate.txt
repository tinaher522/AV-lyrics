<song artist="U2" title="Levitate">
It's in your voice, I can feel it, I can tell (it)
It's in your voice, has me ringing me like a bell
Peace of mind, peace comes dropping slow
I'm in the mind, to let go of control
Spirit come on down, no I'm not coming down
In the backstreets, in the backstreets of our love
Through the locked doors, deep down, deep down is not enough
Spirit come on down, no I'm not coming down
Who can stop us now?
It's much too late
Can't slow us down?
We can't hesitate
I want a love that's hard
As hard as hate
Levitate
To be the bee, to be the bee and the flower
Before the sweetness, before the sweetness turns to sour
When freedom comes, freedom has a scent
It's like the top of a newborn baby's head
Baby we can taste it, you and I
Spirit come on down, no I'm not coming down
Who can stop us now?
Who could make us wait?
Who could slow us down?
Make us hesitate
I want a love that's hard
As hard as hate
Levitate
Oh, lift me up
Spirit come, come on down, no I'm not coming down
Spirit come on down, no I'm not coming down
Spirit come, come on down, no I'm not coming down
Coming down
