<song artist="U2" title="The_Crystal_Ballroom">
Life begins with the first glance
The first kiss at the first dance
All of us are wondering why we’re here
In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier
Wet the glass ’til the glasses sing
We punish our hearts ’til the heart bells ring
‘Cause where we come from
We’re not always kind
The human story is what love leaves behind
We’re the ghosts of love
And we haunt this place
We’re the ghosts of love
In every face
In the ballroom of the crystalline
Everyone’s here with me tonight
Everyone but you
Our first chance is their last dance
Our life is shaped by another’s hands
Buttoning, unbuttoning a Coco dress
Stopping and not stopping every cold caress
Born for bliss, born for this
Every human life begins with a kiss
A kiss by every kind of possibility
And everyone is here tonight with me
We’re the ghosts of love
And we haunt this place
We’re the ghosts of love
In every face
In the ballroom of the crystalline
Everyone’s here with me tonight
Everybody’s here with me tonight
Everybody’s here with me but you
Everybody’s here with me tonight
Everybody’s here with me but you
Everybody’s here with me tonight
Everybody’s here with me but you
Everybody’s here with me tonight
Everybody’s here with me but you
Born for bliss, born for this
Every human life begins with a kiss
