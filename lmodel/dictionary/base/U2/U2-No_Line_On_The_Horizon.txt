<song artist="U2" title="No_Line_On_The_Horizon">
I know a girl who's like the sea
I watch her changing every day for me
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh
One day she's still, the next she swells
You can hear the universe in her sea shells
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh, ooh
No, no line on the horizon
No line
I know a girl with a hole in her heart
She said infinity is a great place to start
Oh oh oh oh
"Time is irrelevant, it's not linear."
Then she put her tongue in my ear
Ah
Oh oh oh oh
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The songs in your head are now on my mind
You put me on pause
I'm trying to rewind
And replay
Every night I have the same dream
I'm hatching some plot, scheming some scheme
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh
I'm a traffic cop, rue du Marais
The sirens wailing
But it's me that wants to get away
Oh oh oh oh, ooh
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
