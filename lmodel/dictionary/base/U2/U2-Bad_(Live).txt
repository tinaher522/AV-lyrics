<song artist="U2" title="Bad_(Live)">
If you twist and turn away 
If you tear yourself in two again 
If I could, you know I would 
If I could, I would 
Let it go 
Surrender 
Dislocate 
If I could throw this 
Lifeless lifeline to the wind 
Leave this heart of clay 
See you break, break away 
Into the night 
Through the rain 
Into the half-light 
Through the flame 
If I could through myself 
Set your spirit free 
I'd lead your heart away 
See you break, break away 
Into the light 
Through the day 
So let it go 
And so to fade away 
To let it go 
A-ha 
And so fade away 
Wide awake 
I'm wide awake 
Wide awake 
I'm not sleeping 
Oh, no, no, no 
I'm not sleeping 
If they should ask 
Well maybe they'd 
Tell me what I should say 
True colors fly in blue and black 
Bruised silken sky and burning flak
Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes 
If I could, you know I would 
If I could, I would 
Let it go... 
This desperation 
Separation 
Condemnation 
Revelation 
In temptation 
Isolation 
Desolation 
Isolation 
Let it go 
A-ha 
And so fade away 
To let it go 
A-ha 
And so fade, fade 
fade away 
Not fade away 
Not fade away 
No, no no 
Not fade away 
I'm Wide awake 
I'm Wide awake 
Wide awake 
I'm Wide awake 
Wide awake 
I'm not sleeping 
Oh, no, no, no 
I'm not sleeping 
Oh no 
Come on down 
Come on down 
Come on down 
Sing it 
Come on down.
