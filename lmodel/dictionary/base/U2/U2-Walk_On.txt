<song artist="U2" title="Walk_On">
And love is not the easy thing
The only baggage that you can bring
Love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind...
And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack,
For a second you turn back
Oh no, be strong
Oh, oh
Walk on, walk on
What you got, they can't steal it
No, they can't even feel it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight
You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been
A place that has to be believed, to be seen
You could have flown away
A singing bird in an open cage
Who will only fly, only fly, for freedom
Oh, oh
Walk on, walk on
What you got, you can't deny it
Can't sell it, or buy it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight
And I know it aches
If your heart breaks
It can only take so much
Walk on
Walk on
Home...
Hard to know what it is, if you never had one
Home...
I can't say where it is, but I know I'm going
Home...
That's where the heart is
And I know it aches
And your heart, it breaks
It can only take so much
Walk on
(Hoooo...)
Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you steal
All this you can't leave behind
All that you reason (It's only time)
(And i'll never fill up all my mind)
All that you sense
All that you scheme
All that you dress-up
All that you've seen
All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate
