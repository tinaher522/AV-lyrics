<song artist="U2" title="Saturday_Night">
They stood on his shadow, they always do
All he wanted to spoil the view
Of people and places, second-hand faces 
He saw but never knew
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She looked like a painting, a picture of you
Depending on your point of view
She laughed with the others, they call out her name
She smiled, she said
Goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
They met at a streetlight though she never knew
All he wanted was to spoil the view
And just for a second, it felt like a year
He waited for her second tear
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh...
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
Can you soar any higher, if you can't let go?
To save her in the fire, she won't say no
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh...
Downtown...
