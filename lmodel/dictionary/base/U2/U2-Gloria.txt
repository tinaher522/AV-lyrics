<song artist="U2" title="Gloria">
I try to sing this song
I, I try to stand up
But I can't find my feet.
I try, I try to speak up
But only in you I'm complete.
Gloria
In te Domine
Gloria
Exultate
Gloria
Gloria
Oh, Lord, loosen my lips.
I try to sing this song
I, I try to get in
But I can't find the door
The door is open
You're standing there, you let me in.
Gloria
In te Domine
Gloria
Exultate
Oh, Lord, if I had anything, anything at all
I'd give it to you.
Gloria
In te domine
Gloria
Gloria
