Daaaaay
Daaaaay 
Daaaaay
Daaaaay 
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful Day 
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend, to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace 
It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day 
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case 
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town, even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you 
It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day 
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case 
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light, and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out 
(Daaaaay) 
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day 
It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day 
What you don't have, you don't need it now
What you don't know, you can feel it somehow
What you don't have, you don't need it now
Don't need it now 
It was a beautiful day
In the sunÂ ??? more summer
