<song artist="U2" title="Angels_Too_Tied_To_The_Ground">
What is it that keeps me back from you?
What is it when I just can't get through?
What is it when we've nothing left to do
But savor the mess that we tried?
What is it when the clock just won't rewind?
What is it when our love seems to stop time?
I'm telling you
Waving a white flag
Baby got a white flag flying for you baby
Got a white flag, white flag
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Ha, ha, ha, ha
And now it's only alive in my head
In my mind
All in my head, in my mind
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh, angels too tied to the ground
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
