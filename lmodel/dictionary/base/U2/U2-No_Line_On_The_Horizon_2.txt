<song artist="U2" title="No_Line_On_The_Horizon_2">
I know a girl
Who's like the sea
I watch her changing
Every day for me
Oh, yeah
Oh oh oh oh
One day she's still
The next she swells
I can hear the universe
In her seashells
Oh, yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh
No line on the horizon
No line
No line on the horizon
No line
I know a girl
Hole in her heart
She said infinity's
A great place to go
Oh, no, you know
It's gonna be our love
The lady sent me in 
To hang your song in, lover
I wanna be the sea
You know, say you're alone
Oh oh oh oh
No line on the horizon
No line
No line on the horizon
No line
Oh (x12)
The song in my head
Is now on my mind
I put you on pause
I try to rewind, oh no
And replay, hey
Every night
I have the same dream
I'm hatching some plot
Scheming some scheme
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh
I'm a traffic cop
Rue de marais
The siren's wailing
And it's me that wants to get away
Oh oh oh oh
No, no line
No, no line
No
No line on the horizon
No
No, no line
Line
No
No line on the horizon
No
No, no line
Line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
