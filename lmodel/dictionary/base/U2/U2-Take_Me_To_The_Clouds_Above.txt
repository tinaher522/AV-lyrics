<song artist="U2" title="Take_Me_To_The_Clouds_Above">
The colours of acension baby
Feel them here 
Feel them on the breeze	
Head to the rare baby
Know the mists energy
The veils that bare
In invitation only
In a welcome to frailty
Strength	
Waiting is forever
Wading in the sound
Live and lapping waters
In a memory bound
The colours of acension 
In a rainbow round
The moon the sun the light
The children of the dawn
