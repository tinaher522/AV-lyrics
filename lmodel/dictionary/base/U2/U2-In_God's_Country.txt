<song artist="U2" title="In_God's_Country">
Yeah
Desert sky
Dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose
Dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dressed all in ribbons and bows
Like a siren she calls to me
Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country, yeah
Set me alight
We'll punch a hole right through the night
Every day the dreamers die
[To] see what's on the other side
She is liberty
And she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold
Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country, yeah
Naked flame
She stands a naked flame
I stand with sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love
