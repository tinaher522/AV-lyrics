Next to it
I was so close to it
I had the universe decoded
Then the atom split
I hear you say 'my oh my'
You know I got no tears to cry
And I got no love left in me now
Just salt in my eye
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I'm down, I'm down
Thunder's loud
But the sun is shining up above the cloud
It's not the noise, it's the deafening silence
Drowns God out
You say I should go for help
But I can't go, go to nobody else
You're like the river flowing underground
I can feel you when you're not around
All because of you
It's all because of you
All because of you
I'm down, we're down
You sadden me, tomorrow now
Slow your tinman heart, tomorrow now
Know, I know yeah
I'm, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm being born
I just arrived, I'm at the door
Of the place I started out from
I want back inside
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
