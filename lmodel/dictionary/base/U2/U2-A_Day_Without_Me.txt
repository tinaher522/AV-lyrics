<song artist="U2" title="A_Day_Without_Me">
Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
I'm dreaming, you're awake
If I wasn't sleeping, what's at stake?
A day without me.
Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?
A day without me.
Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then let go
In the world I left behind
They shed a tear and on they go.
