<song artist="U2" title="Walk_On_(Single_Version)">
And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
And for a second you turn back
Oh no, be strong 
Oh, Oh
Walk on
Walk on
What you got, they can't steal it
No, they can't even feel it
Walk on
Walk on
Stay safe tonight 
You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been
A place that has to be believed to be seen
You could have flown away a singing bird in an open cage
Who will only fly, only fly, for freedom 
Oh Oh
Walk on
Walk on
What you got, they can't deny it
Can't sell it, or buy it
Walk on
Walk on
You stay safe tonight 
And I know it aches
Your heart, it breaks
You can only take so much 
Walk on
Walk on
Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind 
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
And all that you break
All that you measure
All that you deal
All you count on two fingers
And all that you steal
Hallellujah 
Hallellujah
