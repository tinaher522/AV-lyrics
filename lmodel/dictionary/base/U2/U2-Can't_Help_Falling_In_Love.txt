<song artist="U2" title="Can't_Help_Falling_In_Love">
Falling in love
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love with you
Like a river flows
To the sea
So it goes
Somethings were meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life through
But I can't help
Falling in love with you
Oh I can't help
Falling in love with you
Falling in love
Falling in love
Like a river flows
River, river flows...
Falling in love with you
But I can't help
Falling in love with you
