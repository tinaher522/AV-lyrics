<song artist="U2" title="The_Cry-Electric_Co.">
So many cry - so many cry - so many cry
Somebody try - somebody try - somebody try something quick
Don't you look back - don't you look back - don't you look back
So many cry - so many cry - somebody cry
Well I can't see why or what for
What for - what for
Why must I hide from myself, when I need a crowd?
Bring on the crowd - I love the crowd
If you don't know - Electric Co
If you don't know - Electric Co
