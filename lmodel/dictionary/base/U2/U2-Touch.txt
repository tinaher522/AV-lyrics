<song artist="U2" title="Touch">
Thank you 
Don't mention it 
I'm pleased to meet you 
Don't think I'm very good at this 
Let me show 
I don't wanna know 
I just wanna go (down) 
F-f-falling...the world is by your side 
Falling...did you find a place to hide 
I just wanna know 
I just wanna go 
T-t-touching you 
T-t-touching you 
T-t-touching you 
She said, the twenty second floor 
But I said, I can't think what it's for 
I just wanna know 
I don't wanna go 
T-t-touching you 
T-t-touching you 
T-t-touching you 
I'm t-t-touching you 
T-t-touching you 
T-t-touching you 
T-t-touching you
