<song artist="U2" title="Here_Comes_The_Sunset-Chances_Away">
Bono: "Turn up the voice. Yeah, nice. A little reverb in there." 
Bono: "Adam, just change back. Back to where you were." 
It works searching
Those aim
It comes on when you feel it again
I'm lost and I'm wasting for your time
It comes changes
Come around real soon
Why the man
That we coming through
Where the stars
Lie in coals in the room, day
Bono: "Can you do voice, yeah?"
Bono: "Turn the voice up."
It come higher
Ride like the sun
She's like the colors
Of everyone
He went my way
I come once
Right in the colors
All in the sun
Our love is imaginary rain
Our love across the heaven, day
It comes in color
Outside the day
Right up here and all the chain
One morning's raising to her stain
