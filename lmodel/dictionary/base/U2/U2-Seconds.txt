<song artist="U2" title="Seconds">
Takes a second to say goodbye, say goodbye
Takes a second to say goodbye, say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, say bye-bye.
Where you going to now?
Lightning flashes across the sky
East to West, do and die.
Like a thief in the night, see the world by candlelight.
Fall, rise and...
Fall, rise and...
In an apartment on Times Square
You can assemble them anywhere.
Held to ransom, hell to pay
A revolution every day.
U.S.S.R., G.D.R., London, New York, Peking.
It's the puppets, it's the puppets pull the strings.
Fall, rise and...
Fall, rise and...
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye
It takes a second to say goodbye
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh.
Push the button and pull the plug
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh.
Fall, rise and...
Fall, rise and...
And they're doing the atomic bomb
Do they know where the dance comes from?
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb
They want you to sing along.
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye
