<song artist="U2" title="Sweetest_Thing">
Haaaa haa a, Oooh Ooh
My love she throws me like a rubber ball
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
She won't catch me or break my fall
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this I'm a rain cloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Ain't love the sweetest thing
I wanted to run but she made me crawl
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
Oh oh, the sweetest thing
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
This is a blind kind of love
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
I'm losing you
Whoa haaa, I'm losing you
Ain't love the sweetest thing
Ain't love the sweetest thing 
Ain't love the sweetest thing 
Ain't love the sweetest thing
Ahhhh haaa haaaa
Ahhhh haaa haaaa
Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
You can sew it up but you still see the tear
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this I'm a rain cloud
Ours is a stormy kind of love
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
The sweetest thing
Do do do do, do do do do
Ooh Ooh The Sweetest Thing (Bono)
