<song artist="U2" title="Treasure_(Whatever_Happened_To_Pete_The_Chop?)">
I like to smile 
But I like to mostly stay with you
I like good times
But I can't feel this without you
By my song
The heart is in the place I sing this song 
Probably so
Ba, ba, ba, ooh
If I could sigh 
I'd tell the world I'd felt with you 
I like the time 
I like the feeling when 
I feel you in my arms 
I'll take you in my hand 
I'll let you go 
Somebody save me 
Somebody save me 
Sing it 
Sing my, sing my song 
We sing the same old song loud 
Ooh
Smile
Though your heart breaks in two 
Touch me
When will I be with you 
I like good times 
But I can feel it's going wrong 
You sing the same old song 
Now I think it's time to get it right 
Sing it out, sing out
Sing this same old song 
If I could swim, I'd swim in circles 
If I could drown, I'd, I'd drown with you 
If I had enough of my life 
I can't tell 
If I had enough of you
