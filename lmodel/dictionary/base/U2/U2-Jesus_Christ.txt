<song artist="U2" title="Jesus_Christ">
Well Jesus was a man
Who traveled through the land
A hard working man and brave
Well he said to the rich, "Give your money to the poor"
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
So they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Well he went to the preacher
He went to the law
And told them both the same
He said sell all your jewelery and give it to the poor
So they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Oh they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
When Jesus came to town all the working folks around
Believed what he did say
Well the bankers and the preachers
They nailed him on a cross
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
And hard working people
They followed him around
They sung and shouted gay
Well the cops and the soldiers
They nailed him in the air
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Oh they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Oh they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Well this song was written in New York City
Of rich man, preacher and slave
Well if Jesus was to preach what he preached in Galilee
They would lay Jesus Christ in his grave
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Oh they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Oh they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
