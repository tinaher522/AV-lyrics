<song artist="U2" title="Lucifer's_Hands">
Punk rock party in a suburban home
Everybody’s famous here but nobody’s known
We got no music ‘cause the speaker’s blown
Apart
The spill is moving through the seaside town
I’m born again to the latest sound
New wave air wave swirling around my heart
You no longer got a hold on me
I’m outta Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You no longer in control of me
I am
The enemies beg from an inky page
St. John the Divine is gonna take the stage
Like a talent show where your talent is your rage
I’m in
Prayers are fire on ruined dark night
You’re meant to see visions beyond sound and sight
With Elvis beginning to see the light
Amen
You no longer got a hold on me
I’m outta Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You no longer in control of me
I am
Yes, I can change the world
Yes, I can change the world
The poor breaking bread
It’s made out of stone
The rich man won’t eat
He’s eating alone
That’s easy
But I can change the world in me
You no longer got a hold on me
I’m outta Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You no longer in control of me
I am
