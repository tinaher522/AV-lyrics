<song artist="U2" title="Out_Of_Control">
Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
You say how long
It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
Boys and girls
Go to school
And girls
They make children
Not like this one
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood
One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
