<song artist="U2" title="Smile">
Gravity is not pulling me
I won't be a picture with no sign
Decaying I'm praying
You are my abbot
I need the ground to kneel upon
And love can't be your song
I don't want to see you smile
I'm breaking it taking it
I'm breaking it slowly in mind
I'm seeing it freeing it
I know love is in this soul of mine
It's not in your eyes
I don't want
I don't want to see you smile
I started light-hearted
It won't be easy like you said
I'm going flowing
I'm leaving on the day of the dead
I will never get, you will never get
I don't want to see you smile
God knows it, knows it
Knows it, knows it
You sing
Hear me love
Sing it again
Going out blind
The smoke machine is yours not mine
I don't want to see you smile
I will live again
You will live again
I just don't want to see you smile
