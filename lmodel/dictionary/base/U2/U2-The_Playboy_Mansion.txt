<song artist="U2" title="The_Playboy_Mansion">
If coke is a mystery
Michael Jackson history
If beauty is truth
And surgery the Fountain of Youth
What am I to do?
Have I got the gift to get me through
The gates of that mansion?
If OJ is more than a drink
A Big Mac bigger than you think
If perfume is an obsession
Then talk shows confession
What have we got to lose?
I'll never push my way through
The gates of that mansion
I never bought a Lotto ticket
I never parked in anyone's space
And the banks feel like cathedrals
Because casinos took their place
Luck, come on down
I wake up, she'll come around
Chance is a kind of religion
We're down for playin' hard luck
I never did see that movie
And I never did read that book
Luck, come on down
And let my numbers come around
Don't know if I can hold on
Don't know if I'm that strong
Don't know if I can wait that long
'Til the colors come flashing and the lights go on
Then will there be no time for sorrow?
Then will there be no time for shame?
And though I can't say why
I know I've got to believe
We'll go diving in their pool
It's who you know that gets you through
The gates in the Playboy Mansion
In the Playboy Mansion
The Playboy Mansion
Then will there be no time for sorrow?
Then will there be no time for shame?
Then will there be no time for sorrow?
Then will there be no time for pain?
