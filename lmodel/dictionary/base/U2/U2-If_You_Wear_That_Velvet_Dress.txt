<song artist="U2" title="If_You_Wear_That_Velvet_Dress">
Tonight the Moon is playing tricks again
I'm feeling sea sick again
The whole world could just dissolve
Into a glass of water
I've been good 'cause I know you don't want me to
Do you really want me to be blue as you?
It's her daylight that gets me through
We've been here before
Last time you scratched at my door
The Moon was naked and cold
I was like a two-year-old who just wanted more
If you wear that velvet dress
If you wear that velvet dress
Tonight the Moon has drawn its curtains
It's a private show, no one else going to know
I'm wanting
Sunlight, sunlight fills my room
It's sharp and it's clear
But nothing at all like the Moon
It's okay, the struggle for things not to say
I never listened to you anyway
And I got my own hands to pray
But if you wear that velvet dress (if you wear that velvet dress)
But if you wear that velvet dress (if you wear that velvet dress)
The Moon is a mirrorball
Light flickers from across the hall
Who'll catch the star when it falls?
If you wear that velvet dress
