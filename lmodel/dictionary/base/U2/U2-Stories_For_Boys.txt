<song artist="U2" title="Stories_For_Boys">
There's a place I go
When I am far away
There's a TV show
And I can go
Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Oh, oh, oh
There's a picture book
With colour photographs
There's a comic strip
That makes me laugh
Sometimes the lady takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
There's a place I go
And it's a part of me
There's a radio
And I will go
Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Stories for boys
