<song artist="U2" title="Mofo">
Lookin' for to save my, save my soul
Lookin' in the places where no flowers grow
Lookin' for to fill that God shaped hole
Mother, mother sucking rock and roll
Holy dunc, spacejunk comin' in for the splash
White dopes on punk staring into the flash
Lookin' for the baby Jesus under the trash
Mother mother suckin' rock and roll (mother)
Mother (scat singing) rock and roll (mother)
Mother, Mother
Mother, Mother, Mother
Mother, am I still your son?
You know I've waited for so long to hear you say so
Mother, you left and made me someone
Now, I'm still a child, but no one tells me no
Lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world
Lookin' for the father of my two little girls
Got the swing, got the sway, got my straw in lemonade
Still looking for the face I had before the world was made
Mother, mother sucking rock and roll (mother)
Bubble poppin', sugar dropin' rock and roll
(scat singing)
Mother, Mother, Mother
Mother, Mother, Mother
Soothe me, Mother
Rule me, Father
Move me, Brother
Woo me, Sister
Soothe me, Mother
Rule me, Father
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
