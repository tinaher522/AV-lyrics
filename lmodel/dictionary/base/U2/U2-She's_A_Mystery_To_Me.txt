<song artist="U2" title="She's_A_Mystery_To_Me">
Darkness falls and she
Will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is gray
And I need find my way
Without her as my guide
Night comes, I'm fast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn, and burn eternally?
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She... is a mystery girl
In the night of love
Words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn, and burn eternally?
She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She... a mystery
Not quite sure how to end this
