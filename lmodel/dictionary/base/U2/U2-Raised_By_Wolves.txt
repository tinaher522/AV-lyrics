<song artist="U2" title="Raised_By_Wolves">
Face down on a broken street
There’s a man in the corner
In a pool of misery
I’m in white van
As a red sea covers the ground
Metal crash
I can’t tell what it is
But I take a look
And now I’m sorry I did
5:30 on a Friday night
33 good people cut down
I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore
Face down on a pillow of shame
There are some girls with a needle
Tryin’ to spell my name
My body’s not a canvas
My body’s now a toilet wall
I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
Running wild
Running wild
Running wild
Boy sees his father
Crushed under the weight
Of a cross in a passion
Where the passion is hate
Running wild
Blue mink Ford
I’m gonna detonate in your den
Running wild
Blood in the house
Blood in the street
The worst things in the world
Are justified by belief
Running wild
Registration 1385-WZ
Running wild
I don’t believe anymore
Running wild
I don’t believe anymore
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
Running wild
Running wild
Running wild
Running wild
Running wild
