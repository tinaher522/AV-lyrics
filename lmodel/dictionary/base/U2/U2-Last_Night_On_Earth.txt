<song artist="U2" title="Last_Night_On_Earth">
(What the fear calls down, stops the car)
(As it feels like rage)
(She's back on the street)
(But it swings so far away)
She feels the ground is giving way
But she thinks we're better off that way
The more you take, the less you feel
The less you know, the more you believe
The more you have, the more it takes today
CHORUS
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
Well she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on Earth
The last night on Earth
She's not waiting on a saviour to come (How's-ya classy)
She's at the bus-stop with News of the World and the Sun
Sun, here it comes
She's not waiting for anyone
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
Well she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on Earth
The last night on Earth
Clock tells her that time is slipping (slipping away)
Tear drop sunshine (slip slide)
Two sides to one feels missing (too heavy)
Something she might be missing (slipping away)
World turns and we get dizzy (the world turns
Spinning for you (and we get dizzy)
The way it's spinning for me (slipping away)
She's living, living next week now
You know she's going to pay it back somehow
She hasn't been to bed in a week
She'll be dead soon, then she'll sleep
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
You got to give it away (you got to give it away)
Well she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on Earth
The last night on Earth
Last night on Earth
Last night on Earth
Last night
