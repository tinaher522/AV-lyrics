<song artist="U2" title="A_Sort_Of_Homecoming_(Live_From_Wembley)">
And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning
Lights in the distance
And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, desire time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape
Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run
I'll be there, I'll be there
Tonight
We'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
The city walls are all pulled down
The dust a smokescreen all around
See faces plowed like fields that once
Gave no resistance
Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run
And still we run
We run and don't look back
I'll be there, I'll be there
Tonight, Tonight
I'll be there tomorrow
I'll be there somehow
Oh come away, oh come away, oh come
Oh come away say I
Oh come away, oh come away, oh come
Oh come away I say
The wind will crack in wintertime
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words, just a scream
Tonight
We'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
I'll be there, I'll be there
Tonight, Tonight
And your heart beats so slow
In the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning
Lights in the distance
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep
For tonight, with you
I am coming home
I am coming home
