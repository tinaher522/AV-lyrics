<song artist="U2" title="Desire">
Yeah
Lover, I'm on the street
Gonna go where the bright lights and the big city meet
With a red guitar on fire
Desire
She's a candle burning in my room
Yeah, I'm like the needle, needle and spoon
Over the counter with that shotgun
Pretty soon everybody got one
And the fever when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire, right
And the fever getting higher
Desire
Desire
Burning, burning
She's the dollars
She's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise
In the year of election
Oh sister, I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealing hearts at a traveling show
For love or money money money, money money money
Money money money money money
And the fever, getting higher
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire, yeah
Desire
Desire, alright
