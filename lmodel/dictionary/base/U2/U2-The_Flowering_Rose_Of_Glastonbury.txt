<song artist="U2" title="The_Flowering_Rose_Of_Glastonbury">
Take me to the mountain green
You know it but I've  never been
I was packing since the tenth of May
Through distractions along the way.
Pale as snow, the flowering rose, for a flowering rose, I would bend my knee
Came to find, the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury.
You are,
A bucket full of sunshine.
You are,
The miracle that came here to find.
Some things you just can't control,
Sometimes you just let it go.
Knowing you is heaven sent
And music is a sacrament.
Pilgrims on a mountain dream,
You knew it but I've never been.
Pale as snow, the flowering rose, for a flowering rose, I would bend my knee
Came to find, the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury.
You are,
A bucket full of sunshine,
You are,
A miracle that came here to find
All right,
Friend of Jimmy's Club
Down by the river,
When the village is sleeping,
Under the flower of the American dream.
A song that sings when the ...
Living in a dream, you can't be sleeping.
You are,
A bucket full of sunshine,
You have got,
... another time.
You are,
A bucket full of sunshine,
You are,
A miracle that came here to find.
A miracle that came here to find.
A miracle that came here to find.
