<song artist="Pitbull" title="Rock_The_Boat">
We gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found
Rock the boat, break it to the underground
Tonight I'm thirsty and I'm drinking like a grizzly bear
Cause I'm on fire like a chilli super ?
I got a lighting ball on my hair, let's party ?
We're gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found
Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping
Rockin' rockin', keep on hoppin'
Rock the boat, bring it to the underground
Now go, ? the world wide down marvelous
I'm so hot, I'm hotter than lava is
I don't know what you're thinkin' but I hope you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
? don't ? my witness, and I treat sex like it's psychical fitness
Up and down let the ? now baby let me give you the business
First trip baby you gonna see you be riding with me
Second trip, baby you gonna see you be rollin' with me
Third trip, baby you gonna see you be rockin' with me
Forth trip, you gonna be rockin' alone with me
We're gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found
Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping
Rockin' rockin', keep on hoppin'
Rock the boat, ?rockin', keep them rock the boat
Rock it till it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found
Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping
Rockin' rockin', keep on hoppin'
Rock the boat, bring it to the underground
We're gonna rock the boat, rock the boat
We're gonna rock the boat, rock the boat
We're gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found
Rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down
Rock the boat, bring it to the underground.
