Oye, shawty what's happening?
Girl, let's get this thing cracking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you can get mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Shake, shake senora
Shake it left and right
Work, work, work senora
Right into my right
Miami's in the house without a doubt
I'm the chico with clout that they yap about
I'm from the city where the women are real
Bodies all great, but they body parts fake
Kill it, dale

Then take it to Tally for T-Pain

Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
