All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us
Long live this wild wild love

Ladies and gentleman
You're looking at the new Playboy

Who, you?

That's right, Armando Christian Perez
And when it comes to that pretty little beauty, cutie
Don't stop, get it, get it baby, let me pay it
I got that wild love
Love to get wild, dirty, freaky, nasty, yeah I said it
I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same time
Don't believe me, bet it
I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure
Even though it's a kiss one to two
It's a gift and curse for sure
But baby you know that you love it too, that's why
You need it, you want it
All over your body
This loving I'm giving
It's worth more than money
You need it, you want it
All over your body
I know that you want this
Wild, wild, love
G.R.L.
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us
Pitbull
Not only my crown in the player president
The globe is my backyard, baby seven day
When it comes to Miami, I always represent
Read all about, ladies and gents
I'm the chico for the game
I like my women yang
I like my women yang
I like my women fine
I like them off the chain
Take 'em all the world cup, Brazil for the bang
You know I'll meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em
Treat 'em, always keep them feeling right
I don't know if I can handle all five
But baby we can try tonight, dale
You need it, you want it
All over your body
This loving I'm giving
It's worth more money
Pitbull &amp; G.R.L.
You need it, you want it
All over your body
I know that you want this
Wild, wild, love

All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us
