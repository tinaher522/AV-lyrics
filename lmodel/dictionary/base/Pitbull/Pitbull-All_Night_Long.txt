<song artist="Pitbull" title="All_Night_Long">
I see everybody around but it feels like we're in private
I know you want me so bad cause you just can't seem to hide it
The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music,
When we're together,
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the movement,
We can lose it, I hope you're ready
As long as I see the strobe lights,
I'm dancing all night long
When we're together, baby,
I'm feeling all right,
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it all night long,
All night long, all night, night, night
So tell the DJ play it all night long,
All night long, all night, night night
So tell the DJ play it
Tonight the admission is free,
Now we're shutting the club down
We moving now to the streets,
All we got left is love now
Feel my troubles fading to the rhythm of your heart beat,
When we're together,
Everything just comes together baby
Every motion calls your name,
Baby once you start me
And I hope you're ready
So tell the DJ play it,
All my worries help me put the past behind
All around us this worlds in a hurry
While we stand still in time
Feels like we're moving to the rhythm of the music,
When we're together
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the movement
We can't lose it
And I hope you're ready
So tell the DJ play it,
It's only you and me together
And this feelings so strong,
Wish it could stay like this forever
All night long, all night long
Said all night long.
