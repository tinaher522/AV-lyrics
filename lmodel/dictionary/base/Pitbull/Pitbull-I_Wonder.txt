<song artist="Pitbull" title="I_Wonder">
(INTRO - OOBIE)
Everytime I see you, you're tryna' to take me home
And it makes me wonder, if we were to get it on
Would you take the time to touch me (touch me)
And take me into ecstasy yeah
(CHORUS - OOBIE)
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
(VERSE 1 - PITBULL)
Mami what's up wit ya'
I just wanna get to know you better
Mami you tight work
And I know I could get you wetter
I know you hear this a lot
And I know you fed up
I know life is hard
But you gotta keep ya' head up
You got the real game, check
Nail game, check
Hair game, check
Everything, check
That's why I can't wait to slip off your clothes
And lick you from head to toe
And give you some of this fire head till you explode
I wanna make you cum till you can't cum no more (ay, que rico)
I wanna see you girl, roll your toes (ay, que rico)
I wanna be the one to turn you out (ay, que rico)
I'ma show you what I be about
I'm not a hot boy, I'm a hot man
That'll eat yo' ass, till you say god damn
Girl I love this
And if you think you got some undefeated Tyson pussy
Bitch I'm Buster Douglas
(CHORUS - OOBIE)
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
(VERSE 2 - PITBULL)
I wanna be that man, that you've, never had before
I wanna be that man, that'll put it on you fast and slow
I wanna be, everything that you need baby and more
It would be no fun, if I told you everything that's in store
You've got those body parts, I just wanna explore
Como me vuelves loco, ven paca mi amor
You got my two boys, below my waistline, singing the blues
Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to lose
Nothing at all, except climbin the walls (ay, que rico)
Don't lie you know you want some more (ay, que rico)
I'ma have you going crazy, praising the lord (ay, que rico)
I fuck like I rap, hardcore
I'm not a hot boy, I'm a hot man
That'll eat yo' ass, till you say god damn
Girl I love this
And if you think you got some undefeated Tyson pussy
Bitch I'm Buster Douglas
(CHORUS - OOBIE)
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me good love baby
Would you fufill my fantasies
Or would you just do me wrong
