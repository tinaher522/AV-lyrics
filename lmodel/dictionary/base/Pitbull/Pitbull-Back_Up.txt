Big star
Oh, oh 
Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)
I'm in the club and I cut into the scene
Couple of pair fray fool smoking the green
She's got her hand on my nuts what does that mean?
Pointed at her friend and she said there a tag team
Now who said dreams don't come true 
It's like in dreaming when I come through
I always find something to run through
Speak into the mic mami mic check one two (ha, ha, ha)
Drunk in the club off the chain
But who gives a fuck that's why I came
So pour it up and get down 
You have no choice but to listen to Pit now
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Doggy for me and (back up)
Every time I fall I get right (back up)
Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)
Everybody knows Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club DJ's bring it back
When those questions asked but the number one question is (Does he got cash?)
Lil Jon's at the bar while me and the Eastside Boyz smoke out
Roll another one no doubt
Get a couple hoes roll out
Beef you don't want none gun go blao
Dum diddy dum dum my time's now
The city I'm from is coming with better riles
That ol' make your crew run, run, your crew run, run 
It's nice to cum huh
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Doggy for me and (back up)
Every time I fall I get right (back up)
Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up) 
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)
I convinced mami to creep on the DL 
Even though my head is spinning like some Sprewells
Skip the details 
It's the bottom line that's testing my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
All those jeans all that ice all them cars all that's bullshit
If that's what you're looking for keep looking hoe
'Cause you got the wrong one bitch I'll let ya know
Mami's like damn that groupie shout out
Bitch I came to the club to wild out 
If you came to act up 
Then you came to get from me bitch and um back up
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Doggy for me and (back up)
Every time I fall I get right (back up)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Doggy for me and (back up)
Every time I fall I get right (back up)
Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)
Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)
Woo ha
