<song artist="Pitbull" title="Hiya_Hiya">
Ana mchit ou ma nassi.
Hiya mhabla rassi haaaah.
Ana brit nejib nassi.
Dimar ou andi fassi.
Ahhhahahhhh
Samha f dar ou jaya b alf khbar.
Ma ihemha aib ou aar.
Laalala
Samha f dar ou jaya b alf khbar.
Ou ana aliha ma nkdaar.
Laalala
[Chorus: x2]
Hiya li brat, hiya hiya hiyaaaaah.
Li brat laylalay daydaah.
Pitbull aka Christian great.
But please, baby you can call me
I make you fall in love.
I'm a thief with the heart.
To me it's an art.
Baby your eyes don't lie.
I can see you want a little bit of me.
In your life.
I can treat you like the princess you are.
But behind closed doors.
We can do it all.
Ladies first, when I open doors.
I got an open mind, let me open yours.
You can come see me while I'm on tour.
But until then, besitos mi amor.
Samha f dar ou jaya b alf khbar.
Ou ana aliha ma nkdaar.
Laalala
[Chorus: x2]
Watching you, watching me,
Watching you, watching me,
And I'ma give you want right,
Watching you, watching me,
Watching you, watching me,
And I'ma give you want right.
[Chorus: x2]
