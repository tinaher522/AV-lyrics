Pitbull:
Thank God that the world has so many freaks that know how to rap
And if they got to know them no one believed that they know how to hide out
Everybody wanna freaky, freaky pupils in Latin, verse in the freak
Dale loca, ya abre la boca
Get, get, get get freaky
Just looking for a freak that can get with me
Get, get, get get freaky
Just looking for a freak that can get with me
Play N Skills:
You know my heart is needing
Saw you at the club by the door, by the door
You know my heart is dreaming
Find a way to love anymore, anymore, anymore
You’re oh, awaiting
I feel it everywhere that I go
Just take it slow
I need you now, show me how to love
A-Roma:
Why don’t we get freaky?
I wanna drive you home tonight
Locked and tied
Why don’t we get freaky?
Let’s gather all the sheets tonight
Hold you tight
Pitbull:
Get, get, get get freaky
Get, get, get get freaky
Let’s start striping yea
Get freaky can get with me
A-Roma:
Yeah, i wanna drive you home tonight
Loose and tight
Pitbull:
If you like it had I pulled an ass slap
Gonna hit you from the back
Let it be known
All my mammas that think they too good to get freaky
Shut it and be gone!
Defeat, play this game
Y’all gotta got with skills
It’s that little chiko Pitbull from the bottom
With them boys ṗlayin’ Skillz
I see my life it changes
Want you by my side on the floor, on the floor, on the floor
Baby I see you as like angels
Walked alone, my draw go to show, got to show, got to show
Play N Skills:
You’re oh, awaiting
I feel it everywhere that I go
Just take it slow
I need you now, show me how to love
A-Roma:
Why don’t we get freaky?
I wanna drive you home tonight
Locked and tied
Why don’t we get freaky?
Let’s gather all the sheets tonight
Hold you tight
Why don’t we get freaky?
I wanna drive you home tonight
Locked and tied
Why don’t we get freaky?
Let’s gather all the sheets tonight
Hold you tight
Get, get, get get freaky
Just looking for a freak that can get with me
Get, get, get get freaky
Just looking for a freak that can get with me
