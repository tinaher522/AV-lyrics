She's got me like na, na na, na na
Na na na na, na na, na na
(Mr. Worldwide)
(She's got that look in her eyes)
(Enrique Iglesias)
Na, na na, na na
(Like she wants to mess around)
Na na na na, na na, na na
(Enrique, talk to 'em)
I heard it from a friend, who
Heard it from a friend, who
Heard it from another you've been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend too
Told you about me too
'Cause I'mma tell you straight up, I've been messin' around
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
Yeah, I've been messin' around
The way you lick your lips
Yeah, I like that, I like that
When you act like a bad girl
I like that, I like that
That little sexy look you got
Mmm, I like that, I like that
The way you whisper in my ear how you want it when you want it
Girl, I like that
Then let's go, baby, let's ride
Let's not talk about it, let's do it
How you want it, English or Spanish?
Both of them, I'm fluent
We can get freaky in the morning
Or in the afternoon
We can go all night long, baby
It's all up to you
You can get sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want to
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want to
Tell me, you want to?
I heard it from a friend, who
Heard it from a friend, who
Heard it from another you've been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend too
Told you about me too
'Cause I'mma tell you straight up, I've been messin' around
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
Yeah, I've been messin' around
Enrique, let's break it down right quick
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
The way you talk dirty
Yeah, I like that, I like that
The way you bring other girls
Yeah, I like that, I like that
The way you ride them heels
Yeah, I like that, I like that
No thong up under that skirt
Ooh, I like that, I like that
And you can get crazy, yeah, that's cool
You can get loose, yeah, that's cool
We can get some Voli, yeah, that's cool
Let's jump on the bar, yeah, that's cool
Let's push the gas, I'm like ooh
I don't mean to be rude, but I swear to god
There's so many things that I'd love to do to you
You can get sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want to
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want to
Tell me, you want to?
I heard it from a friend, who
Heard it from a friend, who
Heard it from another you've been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend too
Told you about me too
'Cause I'mma tell you straight up, I've been messin' around
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
I've been messin' around (I've been, I've been)
Yeah, I've been messin' around
Enrique, let's break it down right quick
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
Let's mess around
