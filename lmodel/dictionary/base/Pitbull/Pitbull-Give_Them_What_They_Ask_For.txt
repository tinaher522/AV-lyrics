Fuck that club shit, they want that thug shit,
But I aint no thug bitch, and I aint no gangsta bitch, 
I'm a hustla hoe, and I got no problem, 
If you want it you can get it boy I'll bust ya  (EEEYYYOOOOOO)

Anybody wanna test I, who, me, P - I to the motherfuckin T
Its not my fault that your bitch chose me, 
Now her and her girlfriend wanna do me
This is for them boys in dem Chevy's sittin on dem King James... dem 2-3's
and if you gotta problem with me - holla at my lawyer - bitch, sue me
I'm tired of this fuck boy rap, fuck boy this, fuck boy that
Watch a couple movies and they put it in dey rhymes
Wanna-be 50's, I'm straight, you get shot 9 times (HA HA)
10 years in the game, since 9-9 I've been speakin my mind - yes sah!
and aint shit changed, and if you gotta problem, bitch cross Dade County line

&lt;CHORUS&gt;
