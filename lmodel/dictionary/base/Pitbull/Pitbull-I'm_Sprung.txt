<song artist="Pitbull" title="I'm_Sprung">
Oh
She got me doing
What she want to
Now you sprung and I told you
S-p-r-u-n-g
Now you see [x4 fading out]
[Chorus]
I'm Sprung (I'm Sprung)
Dog she got me
Got me doing things I'd never do if you ain't been I'm telling you
(You do)
Its something bout you
That's got me doing things I said never do (never do)
And I can say I'm amazed
The way you put it on me
How you got me chasing you (chasing you)
And I can care less
I could give a damn
To see you (ride and die?)
Look down this bitch
You can take no shit
Keep it real, but I still look fly
(Look taller?)
(I'm tell ya how feel?)
It ain't your face and it ain't your hips (your hips)
Its how you (run around?) to lick them lips
And when I do, shawty you don't even trip
And keep it rumble band for my (crib?)
Keep it fly for my seven (my wheel (my wheel)?)
I'm you nigga gonna be like this done
And when you hoops got me like that (oh) I'm sprung
She got me doin' da dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking 'bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her
[Chorus: x2]
(You do)
Ain't never been a sucker for love (never been a sucker for love)
Never had a girlfriend till I start fucking with her (start fucking with her)
Ain't never even had me locked me down (locked me down)
And she hooked on the wall tryna lock me down (lock me down)
One flip of the tone and I was sprung (I was sprung)
And we get done till 4, 5 in the morn (4, 5 in the morn)
She had me deep in the zone (deep in the zone)
You can get a brand new wardrobe,
But baby you ain't going home (but baby you ain't going home)
But the new jag and all the Louis bags (all the Louis bags)
She nearly got him strait from (bale harbor, bale harbor)
I told my home boys I'd holler (I'd holler)
I got plans for my date, my girl want steaks (girl want steaks)
And she preferred being honest (being honest)
We can go Monday to Sunday don't even matter bout the money (bout the money)
I'm stuck on her (stuck on her)
Never should have let her suck on it (suck on it)
And she hit us up and be home in the next morn
[Chorus: x2]
(You do)
So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gonna do
And I'm feeling so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All my fellas can I get a witness
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everythang with me
Well it all come down to her
