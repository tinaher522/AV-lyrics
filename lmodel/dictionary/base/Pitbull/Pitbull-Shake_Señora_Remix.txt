[Repeat: x4]
My girl got a big ol' booty (hey)
Your girl got a lil ol' booty (hey)
Oh no
Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing cracking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you begin winding
[Repeat: x4]
Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine
Baby, let me see you
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right
Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride
Miami is in the house without a doubt
I am the chico with clout that they yap about
I am from a city where the women are real
Bodies are great, thirty six, twenty four, thirty eight
But their body parts fake
Philly, Cali, I run through your mami
And the ass was off the chain
I hit that thing so hard she called four one one pain
Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing cracking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you begin winding
[Repeat: x4]
Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine
Baby, let me see you
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right
Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride
Miami is in the house without a doubt
I am the chico with clout that they yap about
Everything's a lie that they rap about
Don't believe me? Check their bank accounts
Been around the world, like the sun
And seen more breasts than your new born son
Mami's ass is off the chain
I'ma hit it so hard she gon' call four one one pain
Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing cracking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you begin winding
[Repeat: x4]
Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine
Baby, let me see you
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right
Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride
[Repeat: x4]
One lil two, lil three lil fo'
Five lil six, lil seven lil oh
Oye shawty what's happening
Girl let's get this thing cracking
You just bend it on over
I'll get behind and you begin winding
[Repeat: x4]
Give it to me, dame mama
I like that, dale mama
Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right
Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride
Dale
Oh
Oh
[Repeat: x2]
One lil two, lil three lil fo'
Five lil six, lil seven lil oh
