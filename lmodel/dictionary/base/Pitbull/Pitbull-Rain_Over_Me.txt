Marc Anthony
Girl, my body don't lie (RedOne)
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Outta my mind (Marc Anthony)
So let it rain over me (WHOOOO-HOOOO!!!!!)
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me (WHOOOO-HOOOO!!!!!)
Pitbull
A billion's the new million
Voli's the new vodka
40's the new 30
And baby, you're a rockstar
Dale veterana, que tu sabe
Mas de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me baby or better yet,
Freak me baby, yes, yes
I'm freaky, baby
Imma make sure that your peach feels peachy, baby
No bougie broads, I like my women sexy, classy, sassy
Powerful yes, that love to get a little nasty ow
This ain't a game you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale munequita abra alli, and let it rain over me
Marc Anthony
Girl my body don't lie (WHOO!)
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Outta my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me (WHOOOO-HOOOO!!!!!)
Pitbull
A billion's the new million
Voli's the new vodka
Light is the new majority, ya tu sabe
Next step la casa blanca
No hay carro, nos vamos en balsa
Mami you know the drill, they will know what I got 'til they read the will
I ain't trying, I ain't trying to keep it real
I'm trying to keep wealth and that's for real
Pero mira que tu estas buena, y mira que tu estas dura
Baby no me hables mas, y tirame lo mami chula
No games you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale munequita abra alli, and let it rain over me
Marc Anthony
Girl my body don't lie
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Outta my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh
I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Rain over me
Girl my body don't lie
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Outta my mind
So let it rain over me (Over me)
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me (Over me)
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me (WHOOOO-HOOOO!!!!!)
