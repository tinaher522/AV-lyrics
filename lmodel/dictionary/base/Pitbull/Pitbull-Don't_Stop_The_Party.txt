You don't get them girls loose, loose (TJR!)
You don't get the world loose, loose (Mr. Worldwide)
You don't get money - oof, oof
But I do, I do
You don't get them girls loose, loose
You don't get the world loose, loose
You don't get money - oof, oof
But I do, I do
TJR
I said, y'all having a good time out there?
Pitbull
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
I'm running through the world like a running back
Scarface, world's mine, running back
30,000 people went here to see me?
80,000 in London, Wembley
90,000 people Morocco, and I'm just getting warmed up, papo
Catch me with RedOne in Stockholm
Beirut, cafe, getting my drink on (Voli)
Where all the pretty woman hit the hooka
All of them sweet, azucar, azucar
Dale disfruta
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
TJR

Pitbull
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
I'm from the city, where they stress, yeah they sling keys (305)
And now I'm doing shows in Helsinki (Finland)
I know what y'all thinking, you're thinking,
That you can out-think me, but you can't frankly
I'm out for the vengeance, Frankie (C-Notes)
Just 'cause you ain't me, don't hate me
As a matter fact you should thank me
Even if you don't, you're welcome Yankees
Zig-a zig-a zig-a zig-a-ow
Who got the keys to the world, now? Yours truly - blaow! 
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
TJR
I said, y'all having a good time out there?
Pitbull
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
Imma give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
Imma give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
Imma give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
Get funky, get funky
Now stop!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Que no pare la fiesta - Don't stop the party
