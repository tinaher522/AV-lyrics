<song artist="Pitbull" title="Give_You_Everything">
Me not working hard?
Yea right picture that with a kodak
And better yet, go to times square
Take a picture of me with a kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
And I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight
Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (Lets do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you today
I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Get busy tonight
Cuz to more and more to do bad before and for Prius
Desperate tonight
I can make you my queen
And make love to you eanless
This is insane, the way the name growin', money keep flowin'
Hustlers move aside, so I'm tiptoein, keep flowin'
I gotta locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my life baby
I can make you feel right baby
I can't promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight
Excuse me
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And I think you should let me cause I look good tonight
And we might not get tomorrow
Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
