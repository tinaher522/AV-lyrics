Talking Intro:  Pitbull
Me not working hard?
Yeah right, picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want yall to know that
And tonight lets enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, that's right!

Ne-Yo
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight
Nayer
Dont care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
Til they handle love (lets do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight
Ne-Yo
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em HEY
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Pitbull rap
Take advantage of tonight
Cuz tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen and make love to you endless
Its insane the way the name growin, money keep flowin
Hustla's move in silence so I'm tip-toein'
To keep blowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsey Lohan
Put it on my life baby
I'll make you feel right baby
Cant promise tomorrow, but I'll promise tonight
Dale!
Pitbull sing
Excuse me, and I might drink a little more than I should
Tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could
Tonight
And baby Imma make you feel so good
Tonight
Cuz we might not get tomorrow
Ne-Yo
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight

Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Pitbull
Reach for the stars
And if you dont grab 'em
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it
Cuz if you slip Im gon' fall on top of your girl (HAHA)
What I'm involved in, is deeper than the Mason's
Baby baby, and it aint no secret
My family's from Cuba
But I'm an American and I dont get money like Seacrest
Put it on my life baby
I'll make you feel right baby
Cant promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight
Dale!
