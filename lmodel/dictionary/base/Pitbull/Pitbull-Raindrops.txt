Intro:
Umm... Umm... Umm... Umm...
Anjuli Stars... Pitbull...
This is dedicated to anybody that's lost somebody important in their life
Don't worry they in a better place now
Verse 1 (Anjuli)
I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cause I'm dying each time that I breath in life with out you
Every hour is solemn I need you
I'm devoured, I've fallen now what can I do
There is so much to give 
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside,
Watch as it dies,
I can't even look at the sky,
It's burning my eyes,
Similar to cigarette smoke,
I wish I could float far away from here.
Chorus
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no 

Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops 
Washing me away 4x
Pitbull
Still dealing' with the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie I'm a miss you dog
But you know I'm a ride to the end, I love you
I ain't cry when you died, but i'm a let my tears fall on the track
My brother Uly just came home and it feels good to have him back, welcome home dog
See everything happens for a reason, you don't know what you have till it's gone
That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathing and the words of this song
Are dedicated to Eddie and Barilla, but I know in the future I'm a see ya
I know you both looking down on me proudly, I know ya'll both love me
Chorus
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no 
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops 
Washing me away 4x
Pitbull
See in Life things go wrong, if it don't kill it's only gonna make you strong
So you must hold on, If everything was right then there is something wrong
Ironic ain't it, that's just the way life is, that's why I thank God any chance that I get for blessing me with beautiful kids
What's victory with no loss, what's smiling with no tears, what's love with no hate, what's courage with no fear
Just think about it and apply it to your life and no matter what the problem is, don't worry baby, keep your head up it's gonna be alright
Chorus
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops 
Washing me away 4x
