[Talking: Pitbull]
Hey Jim (laugh) it's like these boys wanna make music for the block, yano, for they hood they city
Im tryna make music for the world. You feel me, right, B.O.B.?
This is what we came up with
[Verse One] [Pitbull]:
I got up today and my flight was late 
On my way to L.A.
I jumped up on a plane
And put on my shades
And threw on my headphones
I was vibin' to this beat
It made me move my feet
Boy that thang was sticky
And then I heard this melody
The dopest one I've ever seen, something out the usual
So Mr. Pilot, please
I think I got a hit on me, hurry to the studio
[Chorus] [B.O.B]
I'll play across the world
Across the world
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Oh
[Verse Two][B.O.B]:
Well i got up today
Put some gas in my tank
To make it to the studio
And then I heard this beat
It made me move my feet
Hell yeah that thang was super dope
And then I sang this melody
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Engineer
Turn up the auto-tune
So I'll be on the radio (radio)

[Chorus][B.O.B]:
I'll play across the world
Across the world
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Oh
[Verse Three][Pitbull]:
Been around the world
Same old song
Now on stage they throw bras and thongs
Long way 
From what I came from
Fightin' in the club just for sayin' somethin'
Now my passports full, I'm out of pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black pink purple orange Caucasians
Latinos, Europeans, and Asians
In Japan they knew all my lyrics it was amazin'
They spoke Spanish: que mas carne, ni mas carne, asi viene sanwich
I guess it's true what they say
Music is the universal language
Its a true blessing you know? 
To travel the globe...
[Chorus][B.O.B]:
I'll play across the world
Across the world
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Oh
