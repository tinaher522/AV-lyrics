[pitbull]
love to hate me
i love that you hate me greatly
i appreciate your love
[rj]
if you want me now
celebrate the love that we have inside
like a full moon rise
right here into my arms
every day i feel i can live or die
if you realize
when you walk right out my life
i don’t wanna lose the fight
but i can’t seem to forget you
even though we’re through
you know it ain’t love, woah oh oh
why am i lost without your touch
you know it ain’t love, woah oh oh
cause this feeling is too much
you know it ain’t love
[pitbull]
uh, yeah
mammi raps right
so i pulled out my d*ck and told her to
speak into the mic
you love me, you hate me
those that love to hate me
i love that you hate me greatly
i appreciate your love
ya'll can throw me in blender for talking sh*t
[rj]
you know it ain’t love
you know it ain’t love
'cause when you open up inside
i can’t keep you from my eyes
you know it ain’t love
[pitbull]
i’ve been politically incorrect since the day i was born
that’s why ’til the day that i die it’s on…
i’ma fight for the cause
when the pitt bites, you know what happens to the jaw
f*ck around and it might be your
big l, big pun, big
[rj]
why are you so bad
this means a heart that burns the fire
can make us higher
you just make me feel sad
this was the best thing i could ever have
that’s the word you said
i was wrong i did not tell you
when i needed you
set me free, why me
but i can’t seem to stop dreaming with all these demons
you know it ain’t love, woah oh oh
why am i lost without your touch
you know it ain’t love, woah oh oh
cause this feeling is too much
you know it ain’t… know it ain’t…
you know it ain’t love
[pitbull]
chances are one in a million
i hear you died in a plane crash
so i guess that makes her one in a million
may you rest in peace
but that’s your job
destiny is somethin’ that you just can’t cheat
if you’re destined to die, it’s just your time, live with it
i don't think y'all got that line
[rj]
you know it ain’t love
no baby
you know it ain’t love
'cause when you open up inside
i can’t keep you from my eyes
you know it ain’t love, yeah
you know it ain’t love
said, you know it ain’t love, baby
don’t tell me, when you know, when you know
you know it ain’t love
