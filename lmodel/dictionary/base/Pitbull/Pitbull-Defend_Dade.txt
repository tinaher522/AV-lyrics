Khaled check this out right.
I know we global now, world wide 305.
But I see that they trying to bring down the movement.
I'm tellin everybody in the crib they can bet on me.
One time, new Diaz (that's right)
Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me. [x4]
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,

You're back won't last with checks you can't cash.
Keep disrespectin', in the the everglades they'll find ya,
I'm not from San Fransisco, but the chopper will forty-nine ya.
I grew up listenin to Luke, and... and... and bumpin Trick
Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed.
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it,
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies.
I seen them trying to bring you down, but fuck that dog you one of the greatest!
Khaled mix 96 up, but even back then you had haters.
I remember Temple at Oynx, I was too young to get in,
I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in.
I remember Unk beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win.
Ya'll can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end.
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)

You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash.
One time TS, two times Fat Joe.
I remember them boys in Wynnwood hood stack short.
I remember them Cash Money Boys in Little Haiti, all runnin with zozs.
Banana Azuri, soft drop top that's fo sho.
Flo-Rida, Grind mode always show love before.
Dammit man I been paying dues, now it's my time to blow.
Even when 50 come through, he don't roll no less than 50 zozs!
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows.
My dog Noseshaker, come through the block on something clean.
Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream.
Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck.
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up.
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like

You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash.
I'm Mr. 305, I'm part of Miami's Heat.
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street.
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat.
I love it when these boys come from out of town and thinking Miamis sweet.
All these boys down here looking for pussy, trying to Miami skeet.
That's when they run up in they hotel room and give them a Miami treat.
When the choppers start a raining, it's hard to stop a Miami leak.
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach.
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY!)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY!)
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY!)
You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash.
Hah, You know what they say in the hood right?
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash Ha ha ha.
If the moneys on the wood, it's all good.
But if the moneys out of sight it's funna to be a fight.
And the last thing you want is a fight with the 305?bitches DALE!
