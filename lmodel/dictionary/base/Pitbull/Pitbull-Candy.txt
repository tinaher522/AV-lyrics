Is you a dime from behind girl?
Is you a dime from behind girl?
Is you a dime from behind girl?
Is you a dime from behind girl?
Is you a dime from behind girl?
You a candy girl
I did it for a many girl
They way that you been running through my mind
Mess around, I pulled a hammy girl
Tryna get them panties girl
Hotter than a beach in Miami girl
And I gotta press my luck
'Cause round his big money no whammies girl
'Cause after this Corona
I'm tryna have a face down
So when I walk up on her
I'm checking from the waist down
I spend a couple on her
We headed to my place now
So when I walk up on ya
I'm checking from the waist down
Shake that piñata
Talking 'bout that candy girl
Shake that piñata
Lemme hit that, lemme hit that
Shake that piñata
Talking 'bout that candy girl
Shake that piñata
Gimmie some of that candy
Shake that thing girl,
Lemme see what you got
Now shake that thing girl,

Come from the bottom, I learned how to hustle
Like Mando ? slash Russell
The nino, a mover a shaker,
So fat, nicks but they won't shake
Now I'm like mommy don't talk, just shake
I ain't got time to burn or bake
She had a face full of MAC but her mind made up
Hey, no dregs, I respect that, you earn that
X marks the spot, just tell me where to turn at
She says she gotta be to work seven thirty, eight
I'm ready, you ready, let's play
Hm, let's play, like a vibrator, let's play
Hm, let's play, like a vibrator, hm
Shake that piñata
Talking 'bout that candy girl
Shake that piñata
Lemme hit that, lemme hit that

Let me have that thing around your neck yeah
Baby let me MArdi Gras you
When I put my body on you
Break through that body armor
Keep a presidential you can be my first lady

'Cause after this Corona
I'm tryna have a face down
So when I walk up on her
I'm checking from the waist down
I spend a couple on her
We headed to my place now
So when I walk up on ya
I'm checking from the waist down
Shake that piñata
Talking 'bout that candy girl
Shake that piñata
Lemme hit that, lemme hit that
