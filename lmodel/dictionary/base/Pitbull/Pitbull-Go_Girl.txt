[Pitbull]
(What would the music be without sounds?)
Young Bo$$, Miss Trina, Pitbull 
Let's show 'em how we get down
I party like a rock star
I look like a movie star
I play like an all-star
I fuck like a porn star
Baby I'm a superstar
Always posted at the bar
Always wit' a couple broads
Maybe I'm just dat dat raw
Dawg check da résumé
I hit somethin' every day
Ask about me and they'll say
That chicko run MIA
Pitbull, Young Bo$$ 
That's fire
Go girl wear it out
Till you're tired
Just tryin' to pay tuition
Liar
My corner is like HBO's wire
So please don't play no games
And baby don't say no names
And we can do this one more again
Next time you can bring your friends
[Pitbull and Young Bo$$]
So go get your friends 
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do dis every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of MySpace
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Shake dem dice and roll 'em
Shake dem dice and roll 'em
When they ask you what's dat dance
You say dat's the hustle man
[Young Bo$$]
Girl I wanna know your name
Girl who you be? 
Don't care wit' who you came
As long as you leave wit' me
What you sippin' on?
I'll buy you a drink
Get you in them shiny things
Your grill be pink 
I see those Jimmy Choos
Those Vera Wangs
I love the way you work
Girl do your thing
You see my stunna shades
I'm like a star 
My click is full of ballas
We at the bar
[Pitbull and Young Bo$$]
So go get your friends 
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do dis every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of MySpace
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Shake dem dice and roll 'em
Shake dem dice and roll 'em
When they ask you what's dat dance
You say dat's the hustle man
[Trina]
Diamond princess
I make 'em bust quick
Man I back it up
Like a mack truck
Don't talk about it boy
Be about it boy
I got them girls boy
Turn out your girls boy
Just talking freak nig
I'm talking freaky shit
'Cause I'm a freaky bitch
[Pitbull and Young Bo$$]
So go get your friends 
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do dis every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of MySpace
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl
Go girl

Shake dem dice and roll 'em
Shake dem dice and roll 'em
When they ask you what's dat dance
You say dat's the hustle man
