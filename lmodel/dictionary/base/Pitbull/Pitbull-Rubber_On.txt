[Pitbull]:
She walks so cold 
But her ass on fire x4
[LMFAO]:
And I said uhhhh
You are like the type of girl I like
And I said uhhhh
I might doble up tonight  (oh yeah)
[Pitbull]:
I said hold on 
And it won't take long 
Baby put this put this put this 
Rubber on! x2
They said that chico there on fire boy
And that's the truth
That chico get nasty that chico get wild
Boy that chico get's loose
He spits off flames, fuego
Reps this town up
Baby come and get this huevo
Y'all can stay on goose 
I stay on ghetto
Llama a los bomberos, hello
When I flip it, i rip it 
I'm on fire
What's up thisÂ ????  I swear it just flies
But baby forget about that
I just wanna hit it 
From the front and the back
I won't go for McCain
Cuz' of his wife president 
She's a little off the chain 
Her
Five kids
She must love to f*ck
And like a square
I'mma save her nuts (HAA!!!)
[LMFAO]:
Uhhhh
You are like the type of girl I like
And I said uhhhh
I might doble up tonight  (oh yeah)
[Pitbull]:
I said hold on 
And it won't take long 
Baby put this put this put this 
Rubber on! x2
