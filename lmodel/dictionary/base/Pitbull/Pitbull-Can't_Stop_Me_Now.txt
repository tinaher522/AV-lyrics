[The New Royales]
Money got your tongue tied
It's a slow ride up till you're goin' down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide when you wear the crown.
(Give it to me)
[Pitbull]
The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
(Can't stop me now)
The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
(Can't stop me now)
They said I couldn't do it but I did it
Fought TBP, beat the most attention
Met with all labels they didn't get it.
Now I'm taken over, fuck with it.
Time to get flithy rich, try to stay not guilty bitch
They said they used to handle bricks
I believe them when they projects are brick
All they rap about is crack and coke
Knowin' they ain't never dealt crack or coke
Yeah it's a joke but thanks
'Cause I'm laughin' all the way to the bank
[The New Royales]
Money got your tongue tied
It's a slow ride up till you're goin' down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide when you wear the crown.

[Pitbull]
The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
(Can't stop me now)
The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
(Can't stop me now)
It's not how you fall, it's how you get back up, dawg
Struggle, hustle, fight hard, that's all I know, that's right, dawg
Blood of a king, heart of a lion (heart of a lion)
Based on rental, pussy boy
Someone please pass me the iron
Death before dishonor,
That means for years I've been dyin'
Stop your blood clots cryin',
I'm here to save Private Ryan

Money got your tongue tied
It's a slow ride up till you're goin' down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide when you wear the crown.

The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
(Can't stop me now)
The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
(Can't stop me now)
The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
The people you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down
(Give it to me)
Can't stop me now
Can't stop me now
Can't stop me now
Can't stop me now
