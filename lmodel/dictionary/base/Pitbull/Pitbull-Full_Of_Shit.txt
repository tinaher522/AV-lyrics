(Pitbull:)
I know you Full Of Shit
Your so Full Of Shit. (x8)
*verse #1:
Believe none of what you hear
&amp; only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
&amp; only half what you see
Believe none of what you hear
&amp; only half of what you see
Let me tell you what I think about there boys out here in the state they call the game
Believe nothing of what you hear &amp; only half of what you see.
*verse #2:
I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pl-pl-pl playing a part
All they talk about is they money, je-je-je-jewels and cars.
So put pha pha phatoms &amp; bentleys
&amp; how they squeeze til its empty
How they move yay hooray
Another doe boy wannabe
All in the club talkin' back
Wha wha what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's
Go str straight to they mama's house
Like southern cali they hardly make it rain or drizzle
That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzle for shizzles.
Uh tell um.
Your so Full Of Shit. (x8)
Believe nothing of what your hear
&amp; only half of what you see. (x4)
*verse #3:
The boy know his alaphabet, so now he think he a G
Run a little Pac so he think he a thug
Bu bu but all eyes on me
They used to wanna be like mike
Now they just want a piece of the mic
They cut fucked-up deals in music
imagine they got 25 to life.
They'll be singing like whitney
Before before she met bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowin' they green like wasabi
They'll be singing like whitney
Before before she met bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowing they green like wasabi.
Now tell um.
Your so Full Of Shit. (x8)
Believe nothing of what you hear
&amp; only half of what you see. (x4)
Your heard me.
*verse #4:
These boys right now they got a house full of cars
A bank account full of money
They act like they on full
But check this out fool
I know your Full Of Shit.
Your so Full Of Shit. (x8)
Believe nothing of what you hear
&amp; only half of what you see. (x4)
