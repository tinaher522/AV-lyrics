Bout to hit the club (club)
Been mobbing all day
Drinkin on some russle dying on some protome
Vip stats straped with my chrome
Looking around the club
What do i see
Everybody rocking side to side to the beat
Snapping they fingers bouncing to the groove all by themselfs
Thats the new move nigga where im from we like to go dumb
Im smoking up the game im seeing how its done
Eh shorty what they call it the poo palce
Straight from bank head
I said you good at it
Do what you do you and yo crew
They even got players and thugs doing it to
The more i drink the more its looking smooth
Its nothing to a boss i can do the shit too
Chourse [x2]
Snap yo fingers
Do yo step
You can do it by yaself
Let me see you do it x2
Chilling in theÂ ??
Yea we gettin crunk
Niggas poping bottles and theses bitches gettin drunk
Rolling up the cush putting it in the air
Im throwing up the e letting them know we in here
Brand new shoes brand new tone
Pull out the old school
Cause im feeling real cool
Yea im from the a so im leaning and rocking
Snapping my fingers then reaching for my glock (bitch)
Repping my block
Straight from the deck
When you snap yo fingers shorty gotta jerk yo neck
Smoking on the best we dont fuck with that mess
Bet you cant do it do it do it like this
Yea im back to the track back to the snap
One two snap then gotta lean back
This is how we do it
In the a town (and if you aint know)
This is how it goes down
Chourse [x2]
Snap yo fingers
Do yo step
You can do it by yaself
Let me see you do it x2
