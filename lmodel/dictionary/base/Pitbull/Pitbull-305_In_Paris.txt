Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
Catch a chico in Paris
Getting money like Arabs
Divroced from the game
But the streets and I bled marriage
I’m allergic to the fake
I’m from the land of cake
Gloves, mask, tape,
Choppa's open .. safe (gimmie that)
Funny talk on the phone
I’m sorry papo, no sale
Down here, yeah they got weight
But I’m sorry papo, no scales
Banana clips they pop
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pill
Think they won’t but they will, 
And they just dying to kill
Voli, bad one, always behind me
Room full of billionaires that’s where you'll find me
So far ahead of the game
They can’t catch me if they rewind me
Pull the trigger yourself,
Blow your brains out and don’t mind me 
Dale!
Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
Flow so hard that chico there crazy
Este chico esta loco
