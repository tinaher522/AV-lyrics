Y'all can't mess with us
Y'all can't play with us
Y'all can't mess with us
Y'all can't play with us
This like mother nature
I really don't give a fuck
We can do it in the club
We can do it outside
We can do it right now what
Little buddie easie up
Please don't cross me like Jesus
I ain't got nothing to prove
As a matter fact I done proved
Everybody wrong yes sir
Only chico in the south yes sir
That's putting it down yes sir
That would be me P.I.T. yes sir
Its all supply and demand
Me I supply the demand
I understand that y'all wanna be me
'Cause I am the man
Mommie threw me on my back
And I was like I was like, dammit man
Then she jump on my mouth
And I was like I was like hum, hum, hum, hum
One mo-gin
Mommie threw me on my back
And I was like I was like, dammit man
Then she jump on my mouth
And I was like I was like hum, hum, hum, hum
Dam Jimmie I wish you were here now
Rest in peace to that chico name Screw
Thanks for believing in me this ones for you
When you see them boys 'round ya way
Holla dammit man
When you see them boys 'round ya way
Holla dammit man
When you see them boys 'round ya way
Holla dammit man
When you see them boys 'round ya way
Holla dammit man
Y'all can't mess with us
Y'all can't play with us
Y'all can't mess with us
Y'all can't play with us
Yep, yep
When I pull up they like, dammit man
In that black Phantum man
'Cause they can't stand it man
Chain 200 grand
Watch with matchin' band
I'm rockin' 3 clovas
(Why?)
I'm from clova land
I'm drinkin' Grey Goose
You drinkin' Redbull
I hang with Zero
I roll with Pitbull
28 we tip on
Candy paint we drip wet
I be in New York
With Killa Cam and Dip Set
I'm packin2 bangers
The other rapper ain't gangsta
(Why?)
You had to say my name
And you still ain't famous
(Damn)
Clover G's don't take no shit
We bake them bitches to come up
Keep runnin' you lip my gun
On my hip so don't run up
Creepin' on a come up
With million dollar shoe deal
Old cars with new wheels
Yellow rocks in blue steal
You know Lil Flip got skills
You know Lil Flip got mills
You can ask B.E.T how the fuck I live
They know I'm rich as fuck
So nuck if you buck
'Cause down in Houston Texas
We jammit screwed up
We riddin' 84's and we also poppin' trunk
