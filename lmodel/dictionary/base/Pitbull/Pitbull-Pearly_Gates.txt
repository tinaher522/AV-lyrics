Nayer
Baby Your All That I Want 
Pitbull
I dont believe in religion, i believe in God, and baby you my heaven
Nayer
Baby Your All That I want, 
When you lying here in my arms
I'm Finding it hard to believe, we're in heaven 
Pitbull
Shes my lady, my baby, my women and
Shes hot as hell, yeah, 
But shes my heaven
She is my Eve, 
Im her apple for example
We got that sinful passion, 
We got that hot lust
We got that one in a million love 
All of the above
Let them talk they envy, 
I love them text's you send me 
With a pic attached
Your girlfriend she friendly
You like a quarterback you'll go down in the sack 
Our love is never ending, that's why they hate like that
Nayer
Baby Your All That I Want 
When Your lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe, were in heaven
And Loving is all that i need 
And it found it there in your heart 
It isn't too hard to see 
Were in heaven
Pitbull
Shes my lady, my baby, my women and
Shes there thick n thin
Shes there rain or fog
Shes there whether I lose or win whether I rise or fall
Shes with me wherever we live lavishly or in poverty
She loves me for me
Armando Perez not Mr. 3-oh-5 thats right
This life can be deceitful
And my career attracts, 
All the wrong people
If you find a keeper 
Then you better keep her
I always put her first, 
Her love is heaven on Earth
Nayer
Baby your all that i want 
When your lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe 
Were in heaven
And Loving is all i need 
And it found it there in your heart 
It isn't too hard to see 
Were in heaven
Baby your all that I want 
When your lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe 
We're in heaven
Love is all I need 
And it found it there in your heart 
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven
Were in heaven
