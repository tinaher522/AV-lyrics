<song artist="Pitbull" title="Dance_Floor">
I got the hat, I got the shoes, I got the outfit
I go outside and pick the right I'm goin' go out with
But right before I hit the streets
I gotta put on my dancing shoes in the mirror
The hat, rock with it, rock with it
The hat, step with it, step with it
The hat, slide with it, slide with it
The hat, ride with it, ride with it
The hat, walk with it, walk with it
The hat, get low
The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go
[Chorus]
I'll be on the dance floor
Don't be tricky with me
Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me
I'll be on the dance floor
That's what I do
In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you
I'll be on the dance floor
Don't be tricky with me
Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me
I'll be on the dance floor
That's what I do
In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you
On the dance floor
I hit the club and I'm ready for a dance hall (a dance hall)
Mr. Dizm 'bout to blow a nigga pants off (his pants off)
So if he wanna ride with me
I'm 'bout to do the same thing that I be in the mirror
The hat, rock with it, rock with it
The hat, step with it, step with it
The hat, slide with it, slide with it
The hat, ride with it, ride with it
The hat, walk with it, walk with it
The hat, get low
The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go
[Chorus]
Hey this is Yo' boy Tay Dizm
You know what I'm saying
That kunamattata you know
Hey, I'm doing this here for the south
You know what I'm saying
My nigga Pain
And I told y'all niggas before he dropped this
Cause anything we touch we know it would be the shit
Like an old school body that's good all out
From the grill to the paint to the dog in the back to the jump off
And if he's not gonna set it off, hit the club
And who's step up to my crew, then this is what my crew goin' do my nigga
The hat, rock with it, rock with it
The hat, step with it, step with it
The hat, slide with it, slide with it
The hat, ride with it, ride with it
The hat, walk with it, walk with it
The hat, get low
The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
