Up in the club
Fuck VIP
P to da I, I to da P
Ying to the Yang
Up in this thang
D to da rock
My nigga Kaine
Up in the cut
Pouring it up
Rolling it up
Holding it up
Ain't her breasts swollen or what
Yes sir, yes sir
Oh, we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I want to be
That makes me too live for your crew
Ho get down get low
I'm crossin' these mama like tic-tac-toe
Let's ride, let's go
Get loose, get crunk, get drunk, get blown
That's right, let's roll
MIA ATL fo sho
[Chorus: x2]

That ho's fine, but, but, but
But this one's a killa
That ho's fine, but, but, but
But this one's a killa
That ho's fine, but, but, but
But this one's a killa
That ho's fine, but, but, but
But this one's a killa
All the lil' mamas, all around the world
Shake that ass if you a nasty girl
Back that ass up says juvenile
Show a nigga some titties
Like girls gone wild
Tear off this clip of clothes
I want to see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road
Where niggas go to see naked ho's
Shake that ass bitch
And be off in the club with a hard-ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you want to make the money
Shawty, work that shit
Put a hump in your back
And lick it raw
To a three point stance
But you mess up yo ass
You must be on that Kayne work out plan
Like head shoulders knees ho's
Shake, shake, just shake, shake
Just shake, shake
Just shake chica, shake, shake
Shake, shake, just shake, shake
Just shake, shake
Just shake chica, shake, shake
Mentirosa

That ho's fine but, but, but
But this one's a killa
That ho's fine but, but, but
But this one's a killa
That ho's fine but, but, but
But this one's a killa
That ho's fine but, but, but
But this one's a killa
Take 'em out and cruise
Take 'em out all dressed
Is the realest true niggas in the ATL
Yeah, we break it down
Better shake a booty ho
And them ho's
And the girl with the real tight clothes
One time for the gang with the Ying Yang twins
We already know we off the reel
Don't tolerate that talkin'
Bitch you can get to walkin'
Patrollers is where I'm groaking
The only way that we are talkin'
If your breath smells like mine
Girls don'are give a fuck 'cause you fine
I diss 'em fo I kiss 'em
I pack 'em fo I stack 'em
So while we in the club
Betta get these girls
'Cause on the streets there ain't no action
Shake, shake, just shake, shake
Just shake, shake
Just shake chica, shake, shake
Shake, shake, just shake, shake
Just shake, shake
Just shake chica, shake, shake
Mentirosa
Mentirosa
Mentirosa
