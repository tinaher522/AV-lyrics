Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
]
In Little Havana
We be eatin' tore up from the floor up, gettin' hammered
Can you go down, down, baby, "Country Grammar"
Sorry Miss Thang, pardon my grammar
But I got gifts and hoes, call me Santa
We don't need no holiday
No we don't
We ain't even on spring break
'Cause I know
We can make our own va-cay
And I can show you how we do it
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
Yeah we like to party
And like to fuck to "Drunk In Love", Beyonc√©
Do ya thang, who cares what they all say
Put your lips like a ring around my Woo!
Now that's a fian-stay
We don't need no holiday
No we don't
We ain't even on spring break
'Cause I know
We can make our own va-cay
And I can show you how we do it
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
