[Pitbull]
Picture me, pullin' up in the truck on twenty fo's
I'm like spinnas, the quicker you stop the faster I go
Don't mess wit' us, ('cause) we quick to cock back and unload
This Pitbull, for those that don't know
All my chicos in the south that's been puttin' it down puttin' in work
Bitches been turnin' them out, snitches get put in the dirt
Pit's been chillin' in the bottom wit' no deals
If them boys talk a lot then they no reals
Shimmy y'all shimmy yam shimmy ya
Catch me wit' Piccolo riding on them thangs ah
See the south is known for ridin' high
'Cause they ride high on twenty fo's and they smoke and drive
Everybody wanna know where's Pitbull from, what has Pitbull done?
I've done enough to have these bitches fiendin' for Pitbull's cum
So when you see me on them tewnty fo's spinning
You know they cut me a serious check
But for now I'm still grindin' fiending for a lickin'
That's some serious shit (Woo!) yeah
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
[Lil Jon]
What?
What?
Ah, let's go!
[Pitbull]
I'm from the land where you name it everything's crooked
Watch what you do 'cause, everything's looking
Man these streets got ears and eyes
And they wanna know it all - who, what, where's, and why's
Everybody wanna know is Pitbull really ridin' twenty fo's
Everybody wanna know if his rims spin, you know how it goes
These streets don't just talk, they gossip like Oprah
Right now I ain't got a damn thang
But the day I get some rims, they'll either spin, chop, or poke ya
When the barrel spin, like the fiend with the rock I smoked ya
On top of the game shit, one day I hope ta
But for now I'm tryin' ta get y'all hooked like that coca-ine-a
Don't start no shit dawg, won't be none
And other than jigga a lot of these rappers? Dawg, I don't see none
So when you see me on them twenty fo's spinning
You know they cut me a serious check
But for now I'm still grindin' fiending for a lickin'
That's some serious shit (Woo!) yeah
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)
They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!)
[Lil Jon]
What?
What?
Ah, let's go!
[Fat Joe]
Ben aqui mami you know you nasty
(Bitches) Them bitch ass niggas that wanna blast me
Yeah I'm still crunk, gettin' drunk off that crunk juice
Hatin' 'cause your girl on me and she hate you
We gotta new napalm bomb (fa colors) dropped down on these
If you pump it ima dislocate your soul from the streets
Remember me lil' g A-town to the O (Oooo)
If you ain't got no money imma get some from your blow
Is ya hatin' 'cause my cup got rhinestones in it?
Is ya hatin' 'cause my twenty fo's keep spinnin'?
G's up and whatever else down!
I done got me some money, oh really? Go act a clown
Lay it down loud, (it'll) get ya shot to the head
But y'all want ya conversation, I just want yo' bread
Ya boi Lil Scrappy B and C and B-M-E clique
All the thug ass bitches get low to the beat!
Don't hate the, the playa
Don't hate the, the game
Don't hate the, the playa
Don't hate the, the game
[Lil Jon]
What?
