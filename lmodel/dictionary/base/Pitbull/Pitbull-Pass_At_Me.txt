<song artist="Pitbull" title="Pass_At_Me">
(Timbaland, David Guetta,
Mister World Wide,
Here we go!)
Everybody goes dance floor and give it up
Baby put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
Everybody goes dance floor and give it up
Baby put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
So listen a couple girls
Who was in and now I mess with cover girls
Of magazines, you can catch me on a cover, girl
I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world
I spit so sick, I'm calling the world
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
?
? but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
? she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl!
Now work it, girl! Like
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control
I gottaÂ ? and I cripple my left
With Timbaland they can't make a breath
?
I got a girl to my right and a girl to my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
