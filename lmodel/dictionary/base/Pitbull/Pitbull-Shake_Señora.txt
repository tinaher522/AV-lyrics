Miami is the house without a doubt
I'm the chico in the club that they yell about
I'm from the city where women are real
Bodies are great but they body parts fake
Killer, Kelly, I run through Miami
And that ass was off the chain
I hit that thang so hard she called 411
Pain, damnit mayne!
Let's go to Jamaica for Sean Paul
Then take it to Talle' for T-Pain
Mami move that ass like chitty chitty bang bang
Chitty chitty bang, bang
