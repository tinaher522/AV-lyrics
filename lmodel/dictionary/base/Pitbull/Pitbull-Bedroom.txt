[Qwote:]
Can I get a bedroom encore? 
Just can't get enough girl I want more 
from when you feel between the sheets tonight 
Is more than I can ask for 
Can I get a bedroom encore? 
Just can't get enough girl I want more 
from when you feel between the sheets tonight 
Is more than I can ask for 
[Pitbull:]
Mami I just wanna ride you 
And giddy giddy up, giddy giddy giddy up 
And take it to the room like 
Giddy giddy boom boom giddy boom giddy bye bye 
And taste tu fruta de bomba 
Como dice el gata 
Dale muyaya 
[Qwote:]
Wanna believe in you, what else can I do? 
Wanna believe it's true when I hold on to you 
Let's make love right under the moon 
Baby it's right here in my bedroom 
Can I get a bedroom encore? 
Just can't get enough girl I want more 
from when you feel between the sheets tonight 
Is more than I can ask for 
Shawty let go go go 
Break it down slow slow slow 
Riding like a pony oh oh 
Until tomorrow 
No one ever said goodbye 
Even if you ask me why 
I keep trying now 
I'm finding how I'm gonna love you so 
Can I get a bedroom encore? 
Just can't get enough girl I want more 
from when you feel between the sheets tonight 
Is more than I can ask for 
Can I get a bedroom bedroom bedroom... 
Can I get a bedroom encore? 
Just can't get enough girl I want more 
from when you feel between the sheets tonight 
Is more than I can ask for 
Wanna believe in you, what else can I do? 
Wanna believe it's true when I hold on to you 
Let's make love right under the moon 
Baby it's right here in my bedroom
