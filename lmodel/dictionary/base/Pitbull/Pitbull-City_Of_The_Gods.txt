[Chorus]
Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa
(repeat 4x)
[Verse 1 - Pitbull]
Woke up this mornin' with my pockets on E
F-ck being broke men this sh-t ain't for me
I'm lookin' for a lick, was sh-ttin' on them bricks
Makin' it rain in the club, outside jack boy sh-t
Make them strip in the dough
Drop that shit, hit that flow
Blow that shit, that's the show
'Cause if you do them things would go pa
[Chorus]
Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa
(repeat 4x)
