(Verse 1)
I'm that maimi boy, maimi raised 
young cuban
they got them old-school maimi ways run up on them with them K's
llama lo dominicanos, tell'em that we got that haze
and we got them chevys, with them westie stops we call'em blaze
all my niggas holiday, everydays a holiday
we give you shells a presents buddy thats how you get sprayed
FUCK
what you niggas say duh
when you hear the K run
nigga get away, hide when you see my face
pity say just in the league of his own all you fools trying to catch up and do what he does might as well leave him alone
I can't wait till my nigga damey come home
till then I'ma keep fighting to be the youngest one holding the throne
