<song artist="Pitbull" title="Castles_Made_Of_Sand">
So you tried to believe in the castles made of the sand
When it flass to the sea and your fear can't find ..
Each from my hand.
I sacrifice my life to give you my life to speakers,
Tryna be good even know I've been crossed like Jesus,
God knows i got a good heart but my blood is filled with demons
I'm fighting myself, believe me, I'm far from ignorance,
Far from greedy if you know where i come from
Know what I've been through, you think that should have been another outcome
Just like most kids or father did it without one come
From the city, with a x you like malcom 
Then you wanna outcome
I can move in the room full of wolves  so switched so smooth,
Thank you mom for making me a man
Let em mother f*ckers knock my castle in the sand
Chorus:
So you tried to believe in the castles made of the sand
When it falls to the sea and your fear can't find ..
Each from my hand, each from my hand.
I'm from the home where the speed the wind is the big apple
Came down the south build the beach and a new castle
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hustle,
Doing what you can't and I'm doing what I have to,
From me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner,
I'm coming out with dinner we're wearing the chinchilla,
I did it for my town to show em the big picture,
Hit the switch, i promise to never switch up,
This is for my brother .. went to jail,
I'm sending all the pictures and of my shows to the mall
He hit me with a letter, i know you never fail,
So put me on a beach with a pocket in the pail
Chorus:
So you tried to believe in the castles made of the sand
When it falls to the sea and your fear can't find ..
Each from my hand, each from my hand.
