<song artist="Pitbull" title="Across_The_World_Pitbull">
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Oh Oh
I got up today
And my flight was late
On my way to L.A
I jumped up on a plane
And put on my shades
And threw on my head phones
I was vibing to this beat
That made me move my feet
Boy that thang? was sticky
And then I heard this (melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual
(Bridge)
So Mr. Pilot please
I think I got a hit on you
Hurry to the studio.
(Chorus)
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Ooh Oh
Well I got up today
Put some gas in my tank
To make it to the studio
And then I heard this beat
It made me move my feet
Hell yeah that thing was super dope
And then I sang this (melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Engineer
Turn up the idol tone
So ill be on the radio
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Ooh Oh
Been around the world
Same old songs
Now on stage
You have raws and thongs
Long way from what I came from
Fighting in the club
For just singing a song
Now my passports full
I'm outta pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black, pink, purple, orange,
Caucasians
Now then those European and
Asian, Anabaenas?
Knew all my lyrics, it was Amazing!
They spoke Spanish
I guess its true what they say
Music is the universal language
It's a true blessing you know
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
