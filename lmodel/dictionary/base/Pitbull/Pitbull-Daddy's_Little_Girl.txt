This is for all the woman that has been stripped of their innocents.
She was Daddy's Little Girl.
No matter what they kept their head up
&amp; this is my way to say thank you.
All alone in the world.
Confused &amp; don't know what to think
She thought that she was, she was Daddy's Little Girl
Confused &amp; don't know what to think
She thought she was, she was Daddy's Little Girl
To fine for herself cause she thought she was Daddy's Little Girl
Daddy's Little Girl
She thought that she was
She was Daddy's Little Girl
Daddy's Little Girl
She was Daddy's Little Girl.
I was raised by woman, a woman made me a man
It just to bad that a man, took her innocents
&amp; god knows that I will feel the shame
Commit the shame end up killin' him
Blame it on the ignorents that's were her childhood went
No country no langues that's how 7 years was spent
Turn's you can't deny it &amp; someone they don't hear
I know that we bump beds, just know Mom Dad I'm here
? up here, the revelotion was great yeah
I wanna thank you Mom for the way were yeah
All your life you want to only one thing
&amp; that was to be.
She was Daddy's Little Girl.
Confused &amp; don't know what to think
She thought that she was, she was Daddy's Little Girl
Confused &amp; don't know what to think
She thought she was, she was Daddy's Little Girl
To fine for herself cause she thought she was Daddy's Little Girl
Daddy's Little Girl
She thought that she was
She was Daddy's Little Girl.
Daddy's Little Girl.
She was Daddy's Little Girl.
Took care of me, just like a mother
'Till you got pregnent, then there was all the tortyre
He was tough but we but we was borded tougher for you cause you had no father
Know I understand know then I'm a man
How much a woman needs someone to call Dad
You cut through the pain, you walked through the rain
The game ain't played you, baby you played the game
Now your in surch of that father figure
If you find him he deny he didn't fucked that
Come as a bitch even though I know she wished
She was Daddy's Little Girl.
Confused &amp; don't know what to think
She thought that she was, she was Daddy's Little Girl
Confused &amp; don't know what to think
She thought she was, she was Daddy's Little Girl
To fine for herself cause she thought she was Daddy's Little Girl
Daddy's Little Girl
She thought that she was
She was Daddy's Little Girl
Daddy's Little Girl
She was Daddy's Little Girl.
This for all the woman who stayed strong &amp; beat all the audience
The ones that have been raped or grew up father less
But still found a way to raise their kids to do the right thing
This for y'all, I love y'all.
