<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Surprise">
(Unintelligible)
It's cool being the only one
But it's lonely
I could have fallen in love a thousand times before 
If only someone had known me
They say there's someone for everyone
Oh but the work would be never done
When all you need is to be met half way 
But nobody tries
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
Needless to say it's a wonderful day
I just noticed how nice it was to know ya
Oh but be ready to sacrifice
If you love 'em you should tell 'em twice
Because when everything that's alive 
Ultimately dies
Oh lord
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Somebody's watchin 
Maybe you want 'em to see you
But with your regrets and secrets you don't 
Really want them to be you
Well you can make believe I'm blind
And for now I'll be just fine
But when the child grows up to have more 
Than just your eyes
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Now the ending to every story is most enchanting 
Now whether its heaven or hell I wear it well
Please forgive me for rambling
I just wanted ya'll 
To know that I don't know it all
So when that big ol' smile ends up
Being just a disguise
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Oh lord
Don't be surprised
Oh lord
Don't be surprised
I said don't be, don't be surprised 
There's nothing left in here 
That's surprising baby 'prising baby
