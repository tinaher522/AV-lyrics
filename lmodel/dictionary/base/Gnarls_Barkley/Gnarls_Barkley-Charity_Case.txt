<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Charity_Case">
Give, give, give it away now
Give, give, give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
I-I-I don't know what matters to you at this moment
But that's all that matters to me
How are you? (How are you?)
Knock on wood
Well I'm not doing so good
About your problem, we couldn't tell
Although you're worth it, I'm still not well
And I don't understand, how I'm so understanding
I guess that that's all I can be
How are you? (How are you?)
I think I can help
But I can't help myself
Should I be happy, you need my help
I usually just talk to myself
Oh can't you see
Oh can't you see
If I help somebody
Maybe there's mercy for me
Ah, charity
(One for you, and you, and you) 
(One for you, and you, and you) 
Don't want to bother you baby
But I'm bleeding too, are you needing me like I'm needing you?
Even my shadow leaves me all alone at night
Guess I need to start to take my own advice
(La la la la la la la la)
(La la la la la la la la)
Oh can't you see
Oh can't you see
Somebody's a liar
Whoever said freedom was free
Ah, charity
Give, give, give it away now
Give, give, give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Alright
Yeah
(Unintelligible)
Charity
Better give it to somebody
