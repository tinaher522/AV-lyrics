<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Open_Book">
Eyes fill with fire
Wish I was a better liar
It hurts when it's happening
And so I cry
The winter is here and colder
I guess that I could have told ya
That I am safe and warm
From the hell inside
Karma (Karma)
Take me (Take me)
Karma (Karma)
Break me
I am an open book
The drumbeat of my heart is tribal
Oh the sweet sound of survival
Shouts serenade
This voice forever more
The sun would have to be frozen
For anything out there opposing
Got to be left in it's own blood 
On the jungle floor
(War)
Karma (Karma)
Take me (Take me)
Karma (Karma)
Strike me
I am an open book
An open book
When I sing a song of peace
It soothes the savage beast
Even it understands
That I understand at least
So you mortals must keep this in mind
This is the way I'm designed
And I am no coward
So I'll only die one time
Karma (Karma)
Kill me
You have (Karma)
To kill me
I am an open book 
An open book
Karma
Karma
