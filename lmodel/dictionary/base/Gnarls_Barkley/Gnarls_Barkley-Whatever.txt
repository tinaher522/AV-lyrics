<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Whatever">
I don't have any friends at all
Cause I have nothing in common with ya'll 
So who's gonna catch me if I fall?
My backs always against the wall
I don't have anything to say
I want everything to go my way
Shut up mom, it is not OK
I'm alone almost every day 
But it's cool (It's cool)
It could be better (Could be better)
I don't care (I don't care)
Whatever (Whatever)
Hold up my man
La la la la la la la
Whatever
La la la la la la la
Whatever
La la la la la la la
Whatever
La la la la la la la
Went to my counselor 'bout how I feel
Everyone agrees I could use some help
I love my girl more than I love myself
She's going steady with someone else
I don't know what else to do
Said fuck me, well fuck you too
I know it sounds real sad but true
Being alone is nothing new
But it's cool (It's cool)
It could be better (Could be better)
I don't care (I don't care) 
Whatever (Whatever)
Whatever bitch
La la la la la la la
(What) Whatever
La la la la la la la
(What) Whatever
La la la la la la la
(What) Whatever
La la la la la la la
(What)
