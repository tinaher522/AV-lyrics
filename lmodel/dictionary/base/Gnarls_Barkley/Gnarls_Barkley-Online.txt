<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Online">
(You) Yeah, yeah
I'm on the line 
I'm on the line 
Once I clean my mirror 
I'm a be feeling fine 
Trying to get there 
Is all that's on my mind 
When they're on the line 
(You) Yeah
Now even when though I run my race 
With a smile on my face 
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy 
Feel like the life of the party 
But it's all in your mind 
On the line 
(You) Ah
I'm on the line 
I'm on the line 
Once I clean my mirror 
I'm a be feeling fine 
Even when you falling 
Just pretend you're flyin'
When you're on the line 
(You) Yeah
I'm with everybody 
But I'm still alone 
Just look down that's my line your standing on 
Let's keep it friendly 
We'll be just fine 
But don't cross that line
(You) No, no, no, no
