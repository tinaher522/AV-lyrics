<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Neighbors">
Now my neighbor likes where I stay
But doesn't know the price that I pay
My neighbor 
My neighbor
My neighbor 
Wants what he sees
My neighbor 
My neighbor
My neighbor 
Thinks he wants to be me
But he'll never be
From out my window
Seems just fine
But in his mind
He's standing where the sun don't shine
So I invited him over
Could this make a new friend
But once I got to know ya
Wish I never let you in
Now my neighbor he, likes my clothes
But hadn't seen me with my scars exposed
My neighbor 
My neighbor
My neighbor
Oh dissatisfied
My neighbor 
My neighbor's 
Behavior 
Is unjustified
I'm sick and tired
I don't know 
If he lives all alone
But if you're scared of the darkness
Best leave the lights on
I had a talk with my neighbor
Said it simple and plain
I guess he understood me
He never came back again
Now my neighbor he likes my car
But no matter where you go, there you are
