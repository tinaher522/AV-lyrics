<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Go_Go_Gadget_Gospel">
[Incomprehensible]look at me
Let me show you how to do it
I'm well on my way
I'm almost everything
And this is my day
You make me want to say
I'm free, look at me
Behold everything I'm allowed to see
Free, come and see
Loot at me
The shapeless, formless, heart is enormous
Bore this, I've worn this, no never what the norm is
Come hear this, it's fearless
Contrast, color, prisms, so warmin'
Listen and love it
I'm free, look at me
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free, come and see
Look at me
What you waitin' on?
I won't ask your, passion, smilin', laughin'
Yieldin', feelin', helpin', healin'
Introduce your neighbor to your Saviour
I'm free, look at me
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free
