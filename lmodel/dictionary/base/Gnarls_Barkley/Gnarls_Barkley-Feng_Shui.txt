<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Feng_Shui">
In this house the decor is obvious up scour
See clearly the theory of less is more
A parapet and books on the shelf
And a frame on the wall where you can picture yourself
And you're welcome to stay
But even the company must compliment the Feng Shui
Even down to what I have on
They do wonder to what extents I have gone
Tailored and tapered couture to the curb
Demanding the attention that it does deserve
Fabrics for the forecast of the day
I admit it, everything is fitted to fall in Feng Shui
More importantly the way that I move
If I'm in your town, my needles down on the groove
On sight they know my song
It ain't slow and it sho ain't long
You see I do not play
Forgive me father, I was forced out of Feng Shui
A flow as subtle as a summer breeze
Like the whispering winds and the talking trees
To big to be boxed in, it bobs and weaves
It evolves, it solves, it gives and receives
And everything I say 
Is calculated, appropriated, written and arranged in Feng Shui
