<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="No_Time_Soon">
This could be one of those days
When we must go our separate ways
It's good for you to be out of my sight
Cause you never know you might
And I carry this
It's heavy
I miss you
Already
You were perfect babe
My time will come, yours too
I barely go before you
I hope you live forever
Or maybe we can go together
It'll be perfect babe
And I carry this
It's heavy
I miss you
Already
You were perfect babe
