<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Would_Be_Killer">
I've got a secret
Something I thought
Maybe I could do
But I can't now can I?
Lucky, lucky you
Did you know I could be
A would be killer
If suddenly I should be
A would be killer
Hurt people
Hurt people
This is always how
Oh, I've been entered by evil
So someone best love me right now
Because I could be 
A would be killer
If suddenly I should be
A would be killer
Now don't you dare me
Or we will dance
High up balancing ballet
So I may still get my chance
