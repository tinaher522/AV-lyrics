<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="A_Little_Better">
Now I can sing you the story line
And if you like my story fine
But ain't none of the glory mine
See my life was a lonely one
And I was still Momma's only son
With no idea what I'm goin' become
And I didn't have long to know 
That you don't have to be grown to go
I could have died so long before
Then I finally saw the sign
And I made it on down the line
One step at a time
I feel a lil' better
I can smile at it now
I feel a lil' better
Oh better 
And even a little is still better
Oh have mercy on me
Oh it's probably plain to see
That I got a whole lotta pain in me
And it will always remain in me
So cold it's a crying shame
Yet here I am trying again
Cause I refuse to die in vain 
The circumstances put soul in me
And there ain't no holding me
I've got a heart made of gold in me
Can you believe this is where I've been
And when adversity comes again
I'll deal with it then
I feel a 'lil better
I can laugh at it now
I feel a 'lil better
Oh better 
And even a little is still better
Oh have mercy on me
Woah
I said everything's fine you can take your time
What would be on your mind if you knew you was dyin'
I would wanna just feel this-a one more time
I said everything's fine take your time
What would be on your mind if you knew you was dyin'
I would wanna just feel this-a one more time
Alright
I wanna thank you morning sun
I wanna thank you loaded gun
Now I know I'm not the only one
I, I wanna thank you friendly ghost 
When all the calls were close
It seems like you cared the most
I, I wanna thank you Mom and Dad 
For hurting me so bad 
But you're the best I ever had
I, I wanna thank you
