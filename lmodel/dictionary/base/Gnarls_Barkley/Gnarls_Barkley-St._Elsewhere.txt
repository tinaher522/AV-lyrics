<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="St._Elsewhere">
I packed a few of my belongings
Left the life that I was living
Just some memories of it
Mostly the ones I can't forget
Whenever you need me I'll be here
Until then my dear
I'm going, I'm going, going there
Don't ask me to make time
To travel back and forth
Let nature take its course
Maybe I'm open from all this ocean air
And if it weren't for you
I'd be without a care
Setting sail to St Elsewhere
(Oh hum hum, oh hum hum)
Anywhere you sit you can see the sun
Unfortunately on this island I'm the only one
Same rules apply on a rainy day
And not such a pretty place to be
It just rains and rains and rains on me
Send a simple sign I can understand
Then a flower grew out that sand
Before you know it I was back out on that sea
Now I don't mind it so much because as long
As I'm not there
Anywhere St Elsewhere, yeah
(Oh hum hum, oh hum hum)
Way over yonder there's a new frontier
Would it be so hard for you
To come and visit me here
I understand
Well just send me a message
In a bottle then baby
(Oh hum hum, oh hum hum)
(Oh hum hum)
(She's a loser)
