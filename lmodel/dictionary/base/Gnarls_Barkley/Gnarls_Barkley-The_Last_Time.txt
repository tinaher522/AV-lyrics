<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="The_Last_Time">
La la la la la
All work and no play
That's the way it is, ain't it?
There's a rhythm deep inside of you
And you must get re-acquainted
When was the last time you danced?
When was the last time you danced?
Well come rock with me baby
Dance with me darling
Step with me sweetheart
The world is watching
Under an endless sky
Wish I could fly away forever (and ever)
And the poetry is so pure
When we are on the floor together (it's been a long time)
When was the last time you danced?
When was the last time you danced?
Well come rock with me baby
Dance with me darlin'
Step with me sweetheart
The world is watching
Don't deny me any further
Let me have my way
Oh, come closer, yeah
Let's dance the night away
Come rock with me baby
Dance with me darlin'
Step with me sweetheart
The world is watching
