<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Mystery_Man">
I may be a mystery
But I'm mostly a man.
And if I can't do what you want me to
Then just let me do what I can
See I knew you'd understand
Now I'm a lover and a smiler
It's only been once or twice that I've ran
But I've been there, I've got the pain to prove it
But I live to fight again
And I know you understand
We're pieces to a puzzle
The big picture and plan
But until I know for certain
You have to take me as I am
And I hope you understand
