<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Going_On">
I've seen it with my own eyes
How we're gettin' otherwise 
Without the luxury of leavin' (of leavin')
The touch and feeling of free 
Is intangible technically 
Something you've got to believe in (believe in)
Connect the cause and effect 
One foot in front of the next 
This is the start of a journey (a journey)
And my mind is already gone 
And that there're other unknowns
Somehow this doesn't concern me (concern me)
And you can stand right there if you want
But I'm going on 
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
To a place in the sun that's nice and warm
I'm going on
And I'm sure they'll have a place for you, too (Oooo-ooo-oo)
Anyone that needs what they want
And doesn't want what they need 
I want nothing to do with (to do with)
And to do what I want 
And to do what I please 
Is first off my to-do list (to-do list)
But every once in a while
I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss (I do miss)
But baby Iâ€˜ve got to go
Baby I've got to know
Baby I've got to prove it (to prove it)
And I'll see you when you get there
But I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
May my love lift you up to the place you belong
I'm going on
And I promise I'll be waiting for you (Oooo-ooo-oo)
freedom is the word and let me tell you a word of advice...don't follow me.
