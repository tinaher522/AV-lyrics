<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Who_Cares?">
Basically I'm complicated
I have a hard time taking the easy way
I wouldn't call it schizophrenia
But I'll be at least 2 people today
If that's okay
And I can go on and on and on (but who cares?)
It's deep how you can be so shallow
And I'm afraid cause I have no fear
And I didn't believe in magic
Until I watched you disappear
I wish you were here
And I can go on and on and on (but who cares?)
You see, everybody is somebody
But nobody wants to be themselves
And if I ever wanted to understand me
I'll have to talk to someone else
Cause every little bit helps
And I can go on and on and on (but who cares?)
Feels like the surreal life
But it's still nice
Wish I could live twice
And I still might
If these bones heal right
I see a little light
Even though it's still night
Feels like the surreal life
But it's still nice
Wish I could live twice
And I still might
If these bones heal right
I see a little light
Even though it's still night
And I can go on and on and on (but who cares?)
And I can go on and on and on (but who cares?)
