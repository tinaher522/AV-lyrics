<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Gone_Daddy_Gone">
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
High school smiles, oh yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now I can only guess
'Cause it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone away
When I see you
Eyes will turn blue
When I see you
A thousand eyes turning blue
'Cause it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone away
And I can tell by the way that you
Switch and walk
And I can see by the way
That you make me talk
And I know by the way that you
Treat your man
I can love you baby, 'til it's a crime
It's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone away
(Gone daddy gone)
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
(Gone daddy gone)
Nicotine smiles, oh yes
(Gone daddy gone)
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
(Gone daddy gone)
Where she is now I can only guess
'Cause it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone away
I'm going away [Repeat 7x]
