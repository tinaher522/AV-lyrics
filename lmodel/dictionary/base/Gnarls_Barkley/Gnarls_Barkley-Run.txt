<song artist="Gnarls_Barkley" title="Run">
Yeah it's still the same
Can't you feel the pain?
When the needle hits the vein
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I've seen it once before
And oh it's something else
Good god
Cool breeze come on in
Sunshine come on down
These are the tear drops of the clown
Circus is coming to town
All I'm saying is sometimes I'm more scared of myself
You better (Move)
I said (Move)
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Run for your life
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Oh
Here it comes
I said run
Yeah I'm on the run
See where I'm coming from
When you see me coming, run
Before you see what I'm running from
No time for question asking, time is passing by
Alright
You can't win child
We've all tried to
You've been lied to
It's all ready inside you
Either you run right now or you'd best get ready to die
You better (Move)
I said (Move)
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Run for your life
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Oh
Here it comes
I said run
Alright

Hurry little children
Run this way
I have got a beast at bay
Promise me when the chance comes
You'll run as fast as you can
Don't you dare look backwards
Run as fast as you can
(Run) La la la la la la la...
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Run for your life
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Oh
Here it comes
I said run
