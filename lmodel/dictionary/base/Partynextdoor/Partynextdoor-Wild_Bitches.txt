<song artist="Partynextdoor" title="Wild_Bitches">
Shorty a killa', come straight from Atlanta
Shawty' a dealer, her momma' a dancer
Poppa' a pimp, cousin a killer
Shawty's my nigga, but my bitch vanilla (Okay)
New to the city, She new to the town
But out there's my water baby, so I hold it down
I'm ya' nigga, I'm ya' nigga
Thought you knew, what the deal was
I'm ya' nigga, I'm ya' nigga
Thought you knew, what it do
You know wild bitches tellin' you lies
You know wild bitches tellin' you lies
You know wild bitches tellin' you lies
Yeah
Talk here ain't cheap, but it's on the budget baby
I lick ya', I dick ya'
And that's world to the public (okay)
Talk hear ain't cheap, girl this what I do
If i lick ya', I dick ya' and that's word to the crew
She new to the city, she new to the town
But out there's my water baby, so I hold it down
It-It-It-It's here, the West side
Baby MI, MI
And I'm out in Miami
Gettin' so high, so high
Uh!
You know wild bitches tellin' you lies
It-It-It-It's here, the West side
Baby MI, MI
And I'm out in Miami
Gettin' so high, so high
Uh!
Shawty' my nigga, down for whateva'
Shawty' my nigga, she always keep it together (Okay)
Shawty' my nigga, down for whateva'
You know wild bitches tellin' you lies
You know wild bitches tellin' you lies
