I gotta keep it super real with ya, shawty
I gotta keep it real real with ya
Yeah you can be his forever baby, but tonight you mine
I pay you in cash baby, he just pay you mine
Tell me you love me baby, and tell me it's mine
It's time and it's money, and money is time
Took my talents out to south beach
Now my pockets looking so deep
I'm on this game baby, Scaring baby
I'm on this game baby, Scaring baby
Out in Miami. Still getting faded
Shouts to the posse, We just so young and belated
I swear, I'm out here winning
Out here getting it
That's just the specifics baby, we get it, we get it
Just let your pussy talk, don't let this feeling fade
Girl cut them bitches off, they ain't got shit to say
Cause, you the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah you can be his forever baby, but tonight you mine
I pay you in cash baby, he just pay you mine
Tell me you love me baby, and tell me it's mine
It's time and it's money. And money is time
Okay you got it. Okay you got it
Champagne on that ass
Just keep it poppin' keep it poppin'
Cause you South Beach soaking for the Sauga City kid
Baby, I'm riding around and getting it
Swear I'm riding around, and they sweating it
Cause I know, I got you for sure
Yeah, couple shots of patron have us right in the zone
Baby, yeah
That's just the specifics baby, we get it, we get it
Just let your pussy talk, Don't let this feeling fade
Girl cut them bitches off, They ain't got shit to say
'Cause, you the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm in a room full of dancers
All of us cancers
One looks like Rita, the other Rihanna
Baby, ooh
I'm in a room full of dancers
All of us cancers
One clears the cash while, the other one dances
Yeah you can be his forever baby, but tonight you mine
I pay you in cash baby, he just pay you mine
Tell me you love me baby, and tell me it's mine
It's time and it's money. And money is time
(So I say)
You the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now
(Yeah, yeah)
(Go let them bitches talk. Don't let this feeling fade)
