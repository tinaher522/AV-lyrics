<song artist="Partynextdoor" title="Juss_Know">
I remember everything, now that I'm watching
I remember everything, just know
I see you then look away, just know
'Cause I remember what you took away, just know
Not everybody's your friend baby, no, no, no, no, no, no
Not every nigga is my nigga baby, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, you used to kiss me then smile, shit that I missed for a while
Oh yeah, oh, oh, I remember everything, I remember everything
I remember everything, I remember everything
I remember everything, now that I'm watching
I remember everything, just know
I see you look away, just know
'Cause I remember what you took away, just know
Remember seeing stupid letters that I used to write you when we broke up
When I said shit like: "When we grow up
I'm a buy you shit when we blow up"
Hey, we were the original Kanye and Kim, you know
Kanye and Kim
That was Drizzy and Rih, it was so obvious then
Oh yeah, you know I remember, I remember everything
Even details about the wedding ring
I got questions about everything
Broke your heart, girl, you deserve these things
Are you still mad that I made you pay for everything, everything
Girl I got it now, girl I got it now, girl I got you now
I remember everything, I remember everything
I remember everything, I remember everything
I remember everything, I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything, now that I'm watching
Just know
I see you look away, just know
'Cause I remember what you took away
I'm never gon' call you, I'm always gon' ball you, I'm ballin'
That's for real, it's the same shit, it's amazing
You know that I been rollin' deep, 713, that's my city, sorry
I didn't know what you did all day, you remember
Girl you know, girl, you do
I know you remember, all day
