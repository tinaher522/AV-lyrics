<song artist="Partynextdoor" title="Ballin'">
I'm out of your league, wavy
I'm out of your league, wavy
Wavy 'cause I'm ballin'
For a minute
I just finished on you
I just finished on you
I just did it on you
Girl I'm out here
Getting to the money
Blowin' these hundreds
Blowin' these hundreds
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Ballin' on you (ballin' ballin' ballin')
I'm ballin' (ballin' ballin' ballin')
I'm out of your league, wavy
I'm out of your league, wavy
Wavy 'cause I'm ballin'
For a minute
I just finished on you
I just finished on you
I just did it on you
Girl I'm out here
Getting to the money
Blowin' these hundreds
Blowin' these hundreds
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Ballin' on you (ballin' ballin' ballin')
Ballin' on you (ballin' ballin' ballin')
That's my baby
Better get you wet now
Better make you sweat now
Better get you wet now
Better make you sweat now
That's my baby
Better get you wet now
Better make you sweat now
That's my baby
Better get you wet now
Better make you sweat now
