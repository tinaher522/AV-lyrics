<song artist="Partynextdoor" title="Let's_Get_Married">
I finally realized what I need
Can only be royal if you loyal girl
And all I need is a woman who will wanna agree with everything that I do
And get naked for me when I want her to
All I need, make it feel like forever
When it's temporary, let's get married
Just 'cause this moment deserves a moment
Just 'cause this moment, deserves a moment
Let's get married, let's get married
I'm a get drunk enough and get crazy enough
To say something just as crazy as let's get married
Let's get married, let's get married
Still I need me a freak, I'm coming straight out of Montego Bay
You working seven days a week
I know how you feel, 'cause I feel the same
We put the same shit in our brain
Not with that molly, coked up on Dolly
All that you need is some green girl you a rockstar when with me
Girl I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, you some times feel
Outta control but baby
Just 'cause this moment deserves a moment
Just 'cause this moment, deserves a moment
Let's get married, let's get married
I'm a get drunk enough and get crazy enough
To say something just as crazy as let's get married
Let's get married, let's get married
