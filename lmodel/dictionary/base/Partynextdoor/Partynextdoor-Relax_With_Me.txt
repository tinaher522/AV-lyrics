<song artist="Partynextdoor" title="Relax_With_Me">
Find a plane ticket, come right now
South Beach, when the sun go down
Soft streets for the sunroof down, soft streets for the sunroof down
There's Gucci this, Gucci that
She used to wear the Baby Phat
Got a budget on yo' ass though
So she let me bust it on ha' ass (Go!)
Hear the clapping, that's the instrumental
Girl yo ass, it's so instrumental
If you gas, let me push the pedal
Every time I lay the pipe, she has a taste for heavy metal
Baby girl yeah you should be a rockstar
Lay that pussy out, fuck me on the sport car
Easy tap down, you, but chu' knew that (but chu' knew that)
She love the way I do that
That's right!
You scared!
Oh, cause I'mma say it right thing
At the right time, at the right place
And you won't know what to do
You won't know how to relax with me
Just relax with me
Girl how you make this taste so fucking well
I (?) into the kitty, watch the pussy swell
I ain't afraid to cross the line with you
I ain't afraid to do a line with you
This a real nigga talkin' to ya'
Sometimes I feel like I'm talking through ya'
19 living like dope boy, double Ms, valet got ha' feeling like a coke boy
Ballin' ball
