<song artist="Sia" title="Be_Good_To_Me">
He said darling don’t forget
There is sweetness left unearthed for you and me
He said, honey no regrets
We just do our best and i…i just wanna cry
Cos you'll be
 
Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you’re down
I’ll be around
I’ll be your every weather
 
He says, this is just today
It will be ok and i …i am listening
He says, you can trust in me
You’ll get all you’ll need and how can i doubt you cos you'll be
Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you’re down
I’ll be around
I’ll be your every weather
 
Bridge
 
You know what you do to me
You light up
You light up
The dark and,
You're all the good within me, my heart, is filled,
Rebuilt
Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you’re down
I’ll be around
I’ll be your every weather
