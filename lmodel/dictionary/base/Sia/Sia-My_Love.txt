<song artist="Sia" title="My_Love">
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, you have found peace
You were searching for relief
You gave it all, into the call
You took a chance and
You took a fall for us
You came thoughtfully, loved me faithfully
You taught me honor, you did it for me
Today you will slip away 
You will wait for me my love
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)
You gave me all 
You gave all you had and now I am whole
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My heart, look what you can do
I am mending, I'll be with you
You took my hand added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me
You loved honestly
Did what you could release 
Aaaahhh oooh
I know in peace we'll go
I won't relive this loss 
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)
You gave me all
You gave all you had and now I am whole
My love, beat inside me.
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, I'll be with you
Oooooohh ooooh
Du du du ooooooh
