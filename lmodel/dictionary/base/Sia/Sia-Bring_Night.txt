<song artist="Sia" title="Bring_Night">
Bring night, bring the night on
Bring a little bit of dance, bring a little bit of song
Bring night, bring the night on
I'm not sure i can wait yeah this day just feels so long
Bring night, bring the night on
The music gets into me and i know it can't be wrong
Bring night, bring the night on
â€˜cos all that we are after is a little bit of fun
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Bring night, bring the night on
Bring me the moon and stars, let's send away the sun
Bring night, bring the night on
And maybe if i'm lucky, i'll end up in your arms
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Instrumental
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
