<song artist="Sia" title="Hurting_Me_Now">
You, you don't like my hair
You don't like what i wear
I'm trying, trying… you see i'm trying
While you try to change me all the time
 
You, you say i talk too much
I know it drives you nuts
You tell me you wish i was better, better yeah
You roll your eyes forgetting i'm in the room
 
You're hurting me now
You take me down and you don't even know it
You think its a joke
But baby you don't, you don't even notice
 
You're hurting me now
You take me down and you don't even now it
You think it's a joke
But baby you don't, you don't even notice
You, you say i sing too loud
I want you to be proud
I want you screaming out "that girl is mine"
"i love her, love her" but you've already tuned me out
 
You, you know these words you say are causing us decay
You feel i am withdrawing  i am running away
You're pushing, you're pushing me…
 
You're hurting me now
You take me down and you don't even know it
You think its a joke
But baby you don't, you don't even notice
 
Don't want you to blow it, you're hurting me
I know you don't know it
Don't want you to blow it
You're hurting me
I know you don't know it
Don't want you to blow it, you're hurting me
I know you don't know it
Don't want you to blow it
You're hurting me
I know you don't know it
 
You're hurting me now
You take me down and you don't even know it
You think its a joke
But baby you don't, you don't even notice
