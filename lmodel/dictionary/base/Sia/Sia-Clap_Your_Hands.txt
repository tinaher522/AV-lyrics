<song artist="Sia" title="Clap_Your_Hands">
Well I've been 
Neglecting the good things 
(oh oh woah) 
Well I've been desiring 
The good things 
I'm biting the lighting 
The good things 
(oh oh woah) 
I've minding what to see 
The good things 
Just let me out of my misery 
(oh oh woah) 
(oh oh) 
On a night like this.. 
Get out of misery 
(oh oh) 
Clap your hands 
Clap your hands 
Turn the lights on my nights 
This is life 
And we only get one chance 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Come on dance 
Take a chance on romance 
We only get one shot at this 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Turn the lights on my nights 
This is life 
And we only get one chance 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Come on dance 
Take a chance on romance 
We only get one shot at this 
Oh... clap your hands 
I'm trying to find in the good things 
I'm finding this might be a good thing 
(oh oh woah woah) 
Just let me out of my misery 
(oh oh oh) 
(oh oh) 
On a night like this.. 
Get out of misery 
(oh oh) 

Clap your hands 
Clap your hands 
Turn the lights on my nights 
This is life 
And we only get one chance 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Come on dance 
Take a chance on romance 
We only get one shot at this 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Turn the lights on my nights 
This is life 
And we only get one chance 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Come on dance 
Take a chance on romance 
We only get one shot at this 

(oh oh) 

Clap your hands 
Clap your hands 
Turn the lights on my nights 
This is life 
And we only get one chance 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Come on dance 
Take a chance on romance 
We only get one shot at this 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Turn the lights on my nights 
This is life 
And we only get one chance 

Clap your Hands 
Clap Your Hands 
Come on dance 
Take a chance on romance 
We only get one shot at this
