<song artist="Sia" title="Sober_And_Unkissed">
Like a new winters coat
I'm wearing your last embrace
like cool quenching glass of water
I hold a clear picture of your face
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
cos soon, I'll be cold and thirsty
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
cos soon, I'll be cold and thirsty
I'm hearing your last telephone call
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest
I hear your invitation to see it all
Better written I am smitten, no protest
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
cos soon, I'll be bored and lonely
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
cos soon, I'll be bored and lonely
I'm tasting the last glass of your wine
The sweet taste lingers, left on lips
I'm tasting your sweet kisses with mine
The sweet taste lingers, left on lips
so, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
cos soon, I'll be sober and unkissed
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
cos soon, I'll be sober and unkissed
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around

cos soon, I'll be sober and unkissed
