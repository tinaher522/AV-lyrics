<song artist="Sia" title="Unstoppable">
I'll smile
I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down
And all through the night time, oh yeah
Oh yeah, I'll tell you what you want to hear
Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah
I put my armor on
Show you how strong I am
I put my armor on
I'll show you that I am..
I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident
Yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today
I break down
Only alone I will cry out loud
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah
I know I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now, yeah
I put my armor on
Show you how strong I am
I put my armor on
I'll show you that I am..
I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident
Yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today
I put my armor on
Show you how strong I am
I put my armor on
I'll show you that I am..
I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident
Yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
Unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today
