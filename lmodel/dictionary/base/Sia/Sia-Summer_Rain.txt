My summer rain
I prepared for the worst in a storm
It doesn't take long before I'm shaking
I watch the news end, wait for the forecast
I fill a tall glass, try to be patient
It's been a long time, I feel my temperature rise
You might be moving too fast, oh
Wait for the sirens, sit in the silence
I sit on my hands
I fear the breeze, fear the seas swelling and drowning me
I fear night, fear the sunlight, I fear everything
I fear your love but I'm done and I surrender now
I want whatever you've got so rain on, rain on down
I thought you were a hurricane
Turned out you were just summer rain
You came to wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
I was mistaken and I feel safe here
So now we're making some kinda rainbow
The storm has broken, true words are spoken
And I am soaking in all your love
So love me for all time, and feel my temperature rise
Thought you were moving too fast, oh
But I was just scared to let you into my head
And let you see my past
I feared the breeze, feared the seas swelling and drowning me
I feared night, feared the sunlight, I feared everything
I feared your love but I'm done and I surrender now
I want whatever you've got so rain on, rain on down
I thought you were a hurricane
Turned out you were just summer rain
You came to wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
When you live in fear
You miss everything
I was struggling
When you stop fighting
The war within
Everybody wins
I thought you were a hurricane
Turned out you were just summer rain
You came to wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
