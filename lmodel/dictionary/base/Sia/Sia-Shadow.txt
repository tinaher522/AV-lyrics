<song artist="Sia" title="Shadow">
Yes, you can take that to heart
It was meant to sit close to the bone anyway
You can make it a big issue
Make it a battle of your own and that's ok
You can feign a distant familiarity
You say you understand the similarity
You think you see me with great clarity
But you're acting me, not necessarily (not sure about that one)
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know
Yes, you can call that a start
It was meant to begin kind of slow anyway
Yes, your deceit is an art (could also be "your deceit isn't odd")
I knew you would sink kind of low anyway
You say you have the best intentions
You fill me with fickle suggestions
Logic is fired by inventions
But your concern is much more than you mention
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know
You say you're in my situation
You say you've been confused by my complication
You think my soul makes negotiation
But you don't see my hesitation
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know
