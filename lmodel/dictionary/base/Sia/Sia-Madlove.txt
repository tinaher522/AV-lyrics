<song artist="Sia" title="Madlove">
Your insensitivity is your personality
A trade that's least favourite
Ha ha funny
You think you're so funny
But you hurt my feelings
We had some good dealings
What have i done recently to make you so mean to me?
I'm oversensitive you say but i think you're nasty today
You make me feel nasty like a control freak
I just want to feel helpful like i'm needed
A sense of reason
You tell your friends i'm a fucking kook
Look how long it took
I've been like this all the time
You don't know what it's like to be me - you're not paranoid, neurotic - you're free
I don't like me much anymore
You make me feel a burden, you make me feel like a bore.
