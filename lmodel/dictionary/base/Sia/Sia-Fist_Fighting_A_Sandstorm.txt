<song artist="Sia" title="Fist_Fighting_A_Sandstorm">
I fought so hard for your heart on the way down
And I thought that I could save you from destruction
But I was never in control, never in control
Fighting a holy war
No, I was never in control, never in control
Fighting a lonely war
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Now I ain't boxing anymore
I'm letting go and it's beautiful
Fist fighting a sandstorm
Fist fighting a sandstorm
Is a losing battle
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Fighting a sandstorm
Fighting a sandstorm
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
But I won't fight it anymore
I'm letting go and it's beautiful
I was hurting, I couldn't let go, couldn't leave you
And I told myself, though it was hell, that we'd push through
But I was never in control, never in control
Fighting a holy war
No, I was never in control, never in control
Fighting a lonely war
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Now I ain't boxing anymore
I'm letting go and it's beautiful
Fist fighting a sandstorm
Fist fighting a sandstorm
Is a losing battle
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Fighting a sandstorm
Fighting a sandstorm
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
But I won't fight it anymore
I'm letting go and it's beautiful
But I was never in control, never in control
Fighting a holy war
No, I was never in control, never in control
Fighting a lonely war
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Now I ain't boxing anymore
I'm letting go and it's beautiful
Fist fighting a sandstorm
Fist fighting a sandstorm
Is a losing battle
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Fighting a sandstorm
Fighting a sandstorm
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
Was fist fighting a sandstorm
But I won't fight it anymore
I'm letting go and it's beautiful
