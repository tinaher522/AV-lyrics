Dynamo
You know all my past is blurred
A vision in glass
You made a place for me in you
And you're a living thing
Some kind of fantasy alone
Neon and lights
Now appearing to me in the view
Some divine illusion calls
Now I'm here to belong
Whisper to me
Come inside
Skyline
Arise in emptiness
Secrets
Appear now touch minds
My Dynamo
Dreamer serene come inside
Glide
You are invited
Secrets that we won't deny
Sky high
Dynamo
Everybody believe it
You're an actual wonder
Somebody's reached me
And it's now my turn
I'm a mad believer
Turn the alchemy on me
On the sidewalk beaches
We play like the sun
Secrets appear and touch minds
Skyline
Climb the emptiness
Secrets appear
Come outside
It's alright
Dynamo
Whisper to me
Come inside
Skyline
Arise in emptiness
Secrets
Appear
Now touch minds
My Dynamo
Whisper to me
Come inside
Skyline
Arise in emptiness
Secrets appear
And touch minds
My Dynamo
Dreamer serene come inside
Glide
You are invited
Secrets that we won't deny
Sky high
Dynamo
