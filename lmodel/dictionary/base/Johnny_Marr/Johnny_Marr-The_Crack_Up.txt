<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="The_Crack_Up">
Dogs at the footsteps transform the more routine
Glamour on the make-up, disguise the money
Lifeless and the life, the face will never be the same
Who could ask for more? Who would ask for more?
Come and see how it’s done in an ever mistake
Your eyes are dynamite, disguise and dominate
The girl can never get lost, how she gonna be found?
She can find herself, she’s gone and drunk tell her that
I won’t follow, she’s out of here
Her smile amounds a metaphor, don’t crack up, it gonna light up
You know you turn, you turn and you can walk, so take off, tic-tac
Who’s gonna fix your walk? And you walk when you’re broken up
Take up, face up, tic-tac, full stop
Don’t you wanna get lost, you know it devastates
Glamour on the monkey, disguise and dominate
The girl can never get lost, how she gonna be found?
Could she find herself? I won’t follow, she’s out of here
Her smile amounds a metaphor, don’t crack up, it gonna light up
You know you turn, you turn and you can walk, so take off, tic-tac
Who’s gonna fix your walk? And you walk when you’re broken up
Take up, face up, tic-tac, full stop
Her smile amounds a metaphor, don’t crack up, it gonna light up
You know you turn, you turn and you can walk, so take off, tic-tac
Who’s gonna fix your walk? And you walk when you’re broken up
Take up, face up, tic-tac, full stop
