<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="Little_King">
In the kingdom Fortuna Free Spirit
He's naked in the world and spinning
Making fortunes out of misfortunes
And blasting all over this land
Breaking the souls and the ghosts of my country
Burning the spirits in the space in the cities
Leaving nothing for a new generation
And never with a change of heart
Well you come for action
Catch the wave
And chase the afterglow
I see the whole quid pro quo
Oh but the show must go on
Taking down all of my loving
And breaking up all of my living
Marching into towns and communities
Tearing up all of this land
Well you're no soldier of fortune
In your kingdom Fortuna Free Spirit
Looting all the population
And you're never gonna change your heart
Well you come for action
Catch the waves
And sell the undertow
I see the whole quid pro quo
Subtract compassion
I see the easy come easy go
Out the way
And go with the flow
No action
Catch the waves
And sail the undertow
I see the whole quid pro quo
Subject subtraction
Oversee the easy come easy go
Crash the walls
And sell the undergrowth
I know it's all the know who you know
Take terrain
The whole quid pro quo
Oh but the show must go on
