<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="This_Tension">
Look to me
Look through me
I'm a conceptual son
With an intellectual gun
Protection
Acting up
I'm after the shock
Like the pure obsessional one
Resolute representation
Our own production
Big scene
Act one
This tension
Look to me
Look through me
Overawed with all the feelings
No supernatural things
Existensual healing
My scene
Walk on
This tension
Ahead of your time
A private enterprise
Minute by minute
Disquiet
Waiting for a ride
And the next lifeline
And the next lifeline
Possessed of desires
Every day that dawns
Gotta get on
Got to get on
Gotta get on
To the future
