<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="Lockdown">
Look out, everyone, I've been pushed hard for surround
Take back they loved, it's a lockdown
Touch out if we want, home is the city, it's gone, I be lose it
And we took back what I want, another lockdown
Freeze out if we want, love is the city, a war and imma lose it
Can I get back what I want in a lost town?
I know I was born just be near these streets and entry speecing
Someone's situation, there's nobody's hope
An education that I still don't know
Coast line and beyond, it's the look out to what's gone
Right now, there's no better in this town
Coast out tonight, help me put out of life
In this town's define me, in this town
I know I was born just be near these streets and entry speecing
Someone's situation, there's nobody's hope
An education that I still don't know
Look out, everyone, freezed out and we was
Give back, come on, lockdown
Touch out, everyone, be fast 'cause we're gone
Come back, it's on, I never lock down, lock down, lock down
