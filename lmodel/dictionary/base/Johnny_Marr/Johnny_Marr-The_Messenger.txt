<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="The_Messenger">
To see it in something life you want it takes long
To see him so happy, you find you talking if you want
Don’t wanna be a messenger, oooh
To see it in something your eyes are opened and you’re on
I’m here and I’m ready, my time’s for taking if you want
Who wants to be a messenger, oooh?
Who wants to be a messenger? (We could get going)
Oooh, oooh, who wants to be a messenger?
Who wants to be a messenger? (We could get going)
Who wants to be a messenger?, oooh? (We could get on)
