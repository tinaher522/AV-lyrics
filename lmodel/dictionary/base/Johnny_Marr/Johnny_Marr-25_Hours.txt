<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="25_Hours">
So are we erasing ourselves?
I am a return
Was born unheard
But anyhow
Me was a word
A word just like now
And so I learned a need
For anyone
And so I know of
Need from anyone
A life ahead
A life of ordinary mind
I said no no!
I am a child of the divine
And so I was told
There was no need for anyone
Yeah, I saw my soul
And I was seeing what it was
All lies ahead
For life of shaking off crime
All eyes ahead
And I was working my mind
And so it goes ...
No need for anyone
And so I forego
A need? ...No
Well, I am erasing myself
The love I need is out there
Worlds I'm leaving
And the door really goes somewhere
Where all I need is myself
And learn all leads to an end
Worlds, I'm leaving
And this door really goes somewhere
Sometimes you look
And you look just like you learned
And some go on
And on some kind of terms
And ever again we march on
Like everyone
And ever again
I ran from all the freaks and priests
Who were hunting me down with attitude
And the heat and the bricks
Were falling on me like doom
Till I seen just everything I had to lose
And I told myself about all I had to do
Oh I am erasing myself
The love I need is out there
Worlds I am leaving
And the door really goes somewhere
Where all I need is myself
And learn all leads to an end
Worlds, I'm leaving
And this door really go somewhere
