<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="European_Me">
Now there is no turning back, once gone it traces impact
Watch out, there’s no changing, a white light, right crawl out
Watch out the sun-covered track
Way before we seen it short come, the where that is a bad life
And losing an empty station, we can be safe from this
Free, free, free, I was outside, now still got a place to go
Way before we’ve seen it short come nowhere but it’s a bad life
You’re losing an empty station again, we get a pass back
And if she want, always wanna come back
We're free, free, free, I was outside, now still got a place to go
Way before we’ve seen the short come nowhere but it’s a bad life
You’re losing an empty station, we can be safe and look
Free, free, free, I was outside, now still got a place to go
