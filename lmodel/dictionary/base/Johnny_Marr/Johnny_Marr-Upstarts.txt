<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="Upstarts">
Oooh, I feel it coming round, I hear it, sounds like the good life, I know
Oooh, I see this running down, defiance comes, oooh
The underground is overground, the overground will pull you down
It's how it goes in these times, how we know it's in their eyes
Upstarts now are on their way, upstarts now have to pay
Oooh, I hear us coming round, denial comes, oooh
The underground is overground, the overground will pull you down
It's how it goes in these times, how we know it's in their eyes
Upstarts now are on their way, upstarts now have to pay
And hear, they tell it now so fast
Oooh, I hear us coming round, oooh, I feel it, upstarts are on their way
