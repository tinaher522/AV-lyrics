<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="The_Trap">
Do you see it coming?
Talking what you want
To conceive what you got
Convince everyone
Silence speaks
Puts me at ease
Think I don't see how it's done
The script and the scenes
I forget to remember
A need to pretend
Gotta breathe to the end
The silence speaks
How could it be that way?
Get out of your mind
Your force and words and lies to disguise
It's a trap, it 's a trap, it's a trap
It won't work and we can't hide
It's a trap, it 's a trap, it's a trap
I thought I knew but I can't decide
It's a trap, it 's a trap
Give in to some
Watching and yearning
But just see what you've done
It's gone all wrong
At zero degrees
It got to be that way
You see it come
And now it feels like
You won't be what you was
Your force and words and lies to disguise
It's a trap, it's a trap, it's a trap
It won't work and we can't hide it
It's a trap, it's a trap, it's a trap
I thought I knew but I can't decide it
It's a trap, it's a trap, it's a trap
You don't love and we don't find it
It 's a trap, it's a trap
Your force and words are lies to disguise
It's a trap, it's a trap, it's a trap
It won't work and we can't hide it
It's a trap, it 's a trap, it's a trap
I thought I knew but I can't decide it
It's a trap, it 's a trap, it's a trap
You don't love and we don't find it
It's a trap, it 's a trap, it's a trap
I thought I knew but I can't decide it
It's a trap, it 's a trap, it's a trap
We don't work and we don't find it
It's a trap, it 's a trap, it's a trap
