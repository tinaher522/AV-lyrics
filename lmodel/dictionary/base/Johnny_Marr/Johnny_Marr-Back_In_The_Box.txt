<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="Back_In_The_Box">
Let me in
Don't stop can't stop
Oh and it's big time
Walk on the wind
Breaking me out
From the inside and the outside
A shock front
Rocked you and rocked you
Double quicklime
Hold the whirlwind
Hanging me up
Like the first time and the last time
Hang on, hang on
The universe explodes
Hang on, hang on
Confusion controls
What's happening?
It's shooting me up
Into the big sky
Just everything
Is breaking us out
From the inside
And the outside
Thoughts blown
Rocked and blocked me
Oh, I'm mystified
Chase the whirlwind
Waking us up
For the first time and the last time
Come on, come on
The universe exposed
Come on. come on
Confusion controls
Day by day by day
By North or South
You can't go home
Confusion controls
Hang on, hang on
The universe explodes
