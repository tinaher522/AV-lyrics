Countdown
Push your button
Activity
Down down down now
Lift up
Lift off
To adrenalin
It was a charge blowing up
Into her brain
Again and again
And again and again
Breathe hard, come alive
Be an open air
Come alive come alive
Come alive come alive
Hands down
Push your button
Activity
A charge blowing up
Into her brain
Again and again
And again and again
And she does
The real buzz
And he does
The real buzz
Heal us
Release us
Break out
In Playland
Let down inhibitionâ€™s sensitivity
Come around come around
Come around come around
Rise up with desire
To adrenalin
Mmmm push the button
To a higher plane
Again and again
And again and again
And he does the real buzz
And she does the real buzz
Heal us
Feel us
Right now
In Playland
Heal us
Free us
Countdown
In Playland
And she does the real buzz
And she does
The real buzz
And he does
The real buzz
Heal us
Free us
Breakout
In Playland
