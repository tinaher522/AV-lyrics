<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="The_Right_Thing_Right">
Love fights love invading my zero gravity
The crowd grows and grows illusions down on quantity street
High speed under approach, wait till smog, shall on innocence
Dark fin, heaven eyes, I believe it all but I don’t feel it
My head’s in the South now, individual citizen, hear it
I hassen up now, individual citizen
Here is the start, just gotta lit
On the right seem right, we gonna right it
Hear me, the wonder of it
On the right seem right, I’m on the right thing
Every words, yeah, I mean it, loses me and now I’m so loud, I can’t resist
I’m what you’re asking, seem to be your voice, so now I can be reached
I’m with, I’m with, I’m with, I’m with, I’m with individual citizen
Here is the start, just gotta lit
On the right seem right, we gonna right it
Hear me, the wonder of it
On the right seem right, I’m on the right thing
Love finds love is following
And what left us to be a voice so far it can’t be reached
I’m with, I’m with, I’m with, I’m with, I’m with individual citizens
Here is the start, just gotta lit
On the right seem right, I’m on the right thing
Take it, life just gotta hit
On the right seem right, I’m on the right thing
Hear it, the sight just won’t quit
On the right seem right, I’m on the right thing
Hear me, the wonder of it
On the right seem right, I’m on the right thing
