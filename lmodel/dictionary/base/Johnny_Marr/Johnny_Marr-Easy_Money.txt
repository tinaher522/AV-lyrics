<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="Easy_Money">
I used to want it all
And that's money money
That's money money
That's money money
Watching human fall
And that's only money
That's money money
That's money money
That's no way to serve
No way to serve
No way to serve nobody
There's no benefit
There is no benefit
No way to benefit somebody
That's not any sense
No innocence
No way no way they sex, no way no
That's no way to serve
That ain't no way to serve
Working for it all
But it's money money
It's money money
It's money money
Watching human fall
And that's only money
That's money money
That's money money
You can walk the street
And it's money money
It's money money
It's money money
Catch the fantasy
'Cause it's money money
That's money money
That's money money
No checks, no loan, no rent to pay
It's gone today
How to accumulate
There's not any sense
There is no innocence
There is money commerce no baby
It's all an expense
The way the pans are set
The way the weather burned nobody
It's just all an expense
No way the world accepts
There is no innocence, no baby
That's no way to hurt
That ain't no way, no sir
Catch a fantasy
'Cause it's money money
It's money money
It's money money
Catch her and degree
And that's money money
That's money money
That's money money
Working for it all
But it's only money
That's money money
That's money money
Watching how we fall
'Cause that's easy money
That's easy money
That's easy money 
No spread, no sum, no lays, no claims
And there's no pain to play
No free fortune so let's just slave
No rainy day better come this way
Working for it all
But it's money money
It's money money
It's money money
Watching human fall
And that's easy money
That's easy money
That's easy money
C'mon come buy the tea
And it's money money
That's easy money
That's easy money
Catch a fantasy
'Cause it's money money
That's easy money
That's easy money
