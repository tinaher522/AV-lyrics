<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="Speak_Out_Reach_Out">
Sophisticated minds
You are your country
Situated in a line
In my city
In a forgotten dream
I can't wake up
Thank you mama
Her Majesty
Hey! hey! hey!
The dream becoming reality
All the day
So...
Reach out
To somebody's God
Cos what you take
Is what you give
Reach out
To get what you want
Cos what it takes
Is all there is
My mind it flies
And it alights
On the panes
Every night I'm getting high
In the doorway
The situation's sublime
Lets face it
Taking from the deaf and the blind
Hey! hey! hey!
At home in a hole in the ground
All the day
So...
Reach out
To somebody's god
Cos what you take
Is what you give
Speak out
Get what you want
Cos what it takes
Is all there is
I'm strung and wound
Beyond all the harmony
And when I die I'm gonna fly
Economy
My dream's a reality always
Thank our mama Her Majesty
Hey! hey! hey!
Sleep under falling leaves
All the day
So...
Reach out
To someone you love
Cos what you take
Is what you give
Reach out
To somebody you love
'Cos all you've got
Is all there is
Speak out
To someone you love
Cos what you take
Is all there is
