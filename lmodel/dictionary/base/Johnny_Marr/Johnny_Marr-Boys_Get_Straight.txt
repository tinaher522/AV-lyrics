<song artist="Johnny_Marr" title="Boys_Get_Straight">
It was one of those times
When I wasn’t really there
“I’m a side effect” I said
In town disintegration was
Doing me in
Do me in again
Sometimes so good
Makes me think of revolution
Can we do it again ?
Something in our blood
Makes people needy people
Consuming again
Boys
Get straight
Shot down
In flames
Small time
Happenings
Too late
Boys
Get straight
Reactivate
Re-load
Sometimes so good
Makes people needy people
Getting used again
Some things in our blood
Makes it so easy for them
Consume consume again
Reactivate
Re-load
Boys
Get straight
Wild life
Escapes
High time
Happenings
Too late
Boys
Get straight
