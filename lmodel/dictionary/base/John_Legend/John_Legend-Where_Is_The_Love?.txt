<song artist="John_Legend" title="Where_Is_The_Love?">
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love
You said you'd give to me
Soon as you were free
Will it ever be? Where is the love?
You told me that you didn't love them
That you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?
Where is the love?
You said was mine all mine
Till the end of time
Was it just a lie? Where is the love?
If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hanging on the promise there
You gotta let me go
Doo doo doo doo
Ohh
Oh, how I wish I never met you
I guess it must have been my fate
To fall in love with someone else in love
All I can do is wait
That's all I can do, oh
Where is the love, doo doo doo, etc
