<song artist="John_Legend" title="Dance_To_The_Music">
Get up and dance to the music!
Get on up and dance to the fonky music!
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet
I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide
You might like to hear my organ
Playing "Ride Sally Ride"
You might like to hear the horns blowin'
Cynthia on the throne, yeah!
Cynthia &amp; Jerry got a message they're sayin'
All the squares, go home!
Dance to the music
Dance to the music...
