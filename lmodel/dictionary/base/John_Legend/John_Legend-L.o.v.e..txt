<song artist="John_Legend" title="L.o.v.e.">
Yeah yeah alright yeah yeah
Uh uh ah ah
All the love so many suffer
We all ask why as they fight for their lives
Can we try the amazing impossible change it
We can't sit by, love just can't let them die
How long till we get it right
How long it will take
Oh we should come together
And we should start today
I know we can do it
There ain't nothing we can't rise above
All we need l.o.v.e love
Love is the resolution, love is the answer
Were all in need of
Is love all we need is love
Yeah yeah alright yeah yeah love
So many voices, so many mothers cry
Can we take the time to listen
Can we try in this time of trouble
We know love is only cure
Is what we are waiting for
How long till we get it right
How long it will take
We should come together
We should start today
I know we can do it
We can rise above
All we need l.o.v.e love
Love is the resolution, love is the answer
Were all in need of
Is love all we need is love
Yeah yeah alright yeah yeah love
Release the love inside
Release the love inside
Is love love
We can turn the light into darkness
We can make it right when is time
Time to conquer hate before its too late
Show them what we need for so long
I know we can do it
We can rise above
All we need l.o.v.e love
Love is the resolution, love is the answer
Were all in need of
Is love all we need is love
Yeah yeah alright yeah yeah love
It all comes back to love
Release the love inside
Release the love inside
Is love love
Yeah yeah alright yeah yeah
