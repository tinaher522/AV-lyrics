<song artist="John_Legend" title="Ordinary_People_Remix">
Girl, I'm in love with you but this ain't the honeymoon
Pass the infatuation phase, we're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love, it seems like we argue every day
I know, I misbehaved and you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow and though love
Sometimes hurts, I still put you first and we'll make
This thing work but I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
This time we'll take it slow
This ain't a movie, no, no fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day, sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again, we kiss
Then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call, we rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances, we take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy, I still want you to stay
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
This time we'll take it slow, take it slow
Maybe, we'll live and learn, maybe, we'll crash and burn
Maybe, you'll stay, maybe, you'll leave
Maybe, you'll return, maybe, another fight
Maybe, we won't survive, maybe, we'll grow
We'll never know, baby, you and I
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe, we should take it slow, hey, hey, hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe' we should take it slow
Take it slow oh,oh,oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow oh,oh,oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow oh,oh,oh, slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
This time we'll take it slow
