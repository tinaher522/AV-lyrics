<song artist="John_Legend" title="Live_It_Up">
You know we've been struggling for such a long time
Working here and there just to get by 
It's finally time for me to get mine
No more, robbing Peter so we can pay Paul
Or going to momma's house to make a phone call
No we dont have to struggle at all
'Cause now everyday is feeling like friday
Im getting paid and doing it my way
We're finally on our way baby now it's time to celebrate
Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high dont want to come down, we'll let 'em know all over town
Live it up, Live it up, live it up
No more, putting it in the lay-a-way
'Cause boo I got the money today
Come on and go to the mall and lets play
Let's go, raise a toast to the days ahead
You can't take it with you when you're dead
You might as well enjoy it now instead
Oh now, it's about to be along evening
We'll party through the rest of the weekend
We're finally on our way baby now it's time to celebrate
Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
Oh we're flying high
We're flying high dont want to come down, we'll let 'em know all over town
And live it up, live it up, live it up
We can fly so high in the moon lit sky 'cause theres no more cloudy days
It's so beautiful when you feel the flow we can dance the night away
Do you remember when times were hard oh so hard
Through it all we've come so far, so we got to live it up
So we can just celebrate theres no more pain
Raise your glass and feel no shame, oh so we got to live it up
Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
Oh we're flying high
We're flying high doont want to come down, we'll let 'em know all over town
And live it up, live it up, live it up
Oh, it's time to celebrate baby
We don't have to worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more
So does it feel good to you
I know it feels good to you
We don't have to worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more
It's time to celebrate baby
Got to live it up
