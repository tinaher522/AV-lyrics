<song artist="John_Legend" title="Under_The_Stars">
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars
We'll find a love to hold our hand through the cold
We'll find an angel light out in the storm
We'll see a light to lead us all the way home
And wherever we go we will know
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars
Let's raise a toast to all the good days to come
Let's celebrate the sea that come out as one
Let's save a kiss for us and the night is done
Oh my love, I'll keep you warm
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars
I'll be lost and lonely
Oh my love was holding on
All of us no matter what we've done
We are not alone, alone with our heart
We are one under a star
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars
Yeah, oh
Under the stars
