<song artist="John_Legend" title="Shelter">
Look over your shoulder
I'm never too far
I'll get to wherever you are
I'll carry your burden
I'll carry your load
I'm here with a hand to hold
Mmm, I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
Through the storm
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
Through the storm
Ten seconds to midnight
No morning side
Full moon in the tat is high
I'll be your bridge over the water
Fire when it's cold
I'll be the best friend you know
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
Through the storm
Yeah, yeah
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
Through the storm
Yeah, yeah
Oh I will be yours but love
My love, my love
Thunder is raging
I won't give up
I don't know what life has in store
But I know that I will be your
I will be yours
I will be yours
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
Through the storm
Yeah, yeah
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
I will be your shelter
Through the storm
Ah, aah, be your shelter through the storm mmmm.
