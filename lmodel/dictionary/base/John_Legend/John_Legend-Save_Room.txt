<song artist="John_Legend" title="Save_Room">
Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
just a little bit of love Is worth a moment of your time
knocking on your door just a little
so cold outside tonight
let's get a fire burning
oh I know, I keep it burning right
If you stay, won't you stay - stay
save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love save a little
save a little for me
won't you save a little
save a little for me - ohh
This just might hurt a little
love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Don't be afraid of a little bit of pain
pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me - pretty baby
You will see I can be all you need
If you stay, won't you stay - stay
save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love save a little
save a little for me
won't you save a little
save a little for me - ohh
(pa-ya-pa-pa) - (pa-ya-pa-pa) - (pa-ya-pa-pa) - (da-da-da)
Ohhh come on
Make time to live a little
don't let this moment slip by tonight
you never know what you are missing 'til you try
I'll keep you satisfied
if you stay, won't you stay - stay
save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love save a little
save a little for me
won't you save a little
save a little for me - ohh
save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love
save a little, save a little for me
won't you save a little
save a little for me
