<song artist="John_Legend" title="Sun_Comes_Up">
I know you think I'm like the other man
You let him in and then he breaks your heart again
But this thing is more than physical
I free your mind and I bless your soul
Tonight we're gonna lose track of time
Body and spirit will intertwine
And we'll stay here the rest of the night
Baby when the sun comes up
I'm gonna be holding you
Its destiny that you're next to me
I'm in love with you
Oh baby, when I wake up, 
I'm gonna be next to you
a new day rise
I wanna look in your eyes, I'm in love with you
Wait a minute baby, I'm not through
I intend to spend more than one night with you
A love affair that never ends
Like the old song says "lets do it again"
Come with me
I know you'll stay
You'll wake up in the morning to a brand new day
That begins the rest of your life
And baby, 
Baby when the sun comes up
I'm gonna be holding you
Its destiny that you're next to me
I'm in love with you
Oh baby, when I wake up, 
I'm gonna be next to you
A new day rise
I wanna look in your eyes
And when morning breaks
Ill awaken and I won't want you to go
When your gone ill hold on to the memory all day
Baby when the sun comes up
Yeah, yeah yeah
So listen here now
I know you've been hurt by the wonderful
And I know your pain
And I know you never thought you could love again
But I know the way
Yeah yeah yeah
I know about your circumstance, but love is here with a second chance
So ah take my hand and follow me
You'll never want to leave
You'll still be here, oh yeah when the sun comes up
You'll still be here oh yeah when the sun comes up
You'll still be here in the morning when the sun comes up
Yeah yeah oh yeah when the sun comes up
Yeah eh eh eh oh yeah when the sun comes up
In the morning when i rise i wanna look into your eyes yeah when the sun
Oh oh oh oh when the sun comes up
Yeah .... when the sun comes up
Yeah yeah when the sun comes up
Yeah yeah eh oho when the sun comes up
ohooo when the sun comes up
Baby when the sun comes up yeah
