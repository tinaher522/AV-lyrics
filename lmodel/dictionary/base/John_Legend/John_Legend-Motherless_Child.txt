(PIANO) 
WHOOAOO 
Sometime I feel 
Like a motherless Child 
Sometimes I feel 
Like a motherless child 
And sometimes I feel 
Like a motherless child 
A long...long way...from home 
WHOOAOO 
And Sometimes i feel 
Like I'm almost gone 
Sometimes I feel WHOAOAO 
Like I'm almost gone 
Sometimes I feel yeahehe 
Like I'm All Alone 
A long...a looong wayee from home 
C'mon, C'mon 
Whos Got A Shoulder When I need to cry 
I feel restless and I don't know why 
Cry for help, but still feel alone 
Like A motherless child along way from home 
Lord I'm lost I can't find my way 
I'm Dealin With The Struglles in my day to day 
My Soul Is Weak and I wanna be strong 
I try to run away but I've been running to long 
I've been running to long... 
I've Been running to long 
HEEY 
Whos Got A Shoulder When I Need To Cry 
I feel restless and I don't know why 
Cry for help, but I still feel alone 
Like A motherless child along way from home 
Lord I'm lost I can't find my way 
I'm Dealin With The Struglles in my day to day 
My Soul Is Weak and I wanna be strong 
I try to run away but I've been running to long 
I've been running to long... 
I've Been running to long 
Like A Motherless Child (X4) 
So Lost And so long 
Like a motherless Child
