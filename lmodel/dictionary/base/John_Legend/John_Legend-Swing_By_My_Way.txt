<song artist="John_Legend" title="Swing_By_My_Way">
Lady over by the bar
Lookin' like a movie start
I gotta know just who you are so tell me you name
I like the way you groove and glide
I like the way you slip and slide
Maybe later on tonight you'll come play with me
And oh, show me to another place
And oh, show me how your honey taste
And oh, tell me what it takes for you toâ?¦
Swing by my way
Swing by my way
Maybe we should slow it down
Or maybe we should just head out
Or maybe I should kiss you now right here on the floor
Cause baby when you move like that
You're givin' me a heart attack
But still you got me comin' back and beggin' for more
And oh, show me to another place
And oh, show me how your honey taste
And oh, tell me what it takes for you toâ?¦
Swing by my way
Swing by my way
And, baby oh wee
Watch yourself you might be comin' home with me
Grab your purse and baby let me grab my keys
Let's get up out this place and maybeâ?¦
Swing by my way
Swing by my way
Lady over by the bar
Lookin' like a movie start
I gotta know just who you are so tell me you name
I like the way you groove and glide
I like the way you slip and slide
Maybe later on tonight you'll come play with me
