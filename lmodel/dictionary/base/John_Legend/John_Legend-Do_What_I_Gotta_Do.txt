<song artist="John_Legend" title="Do_What_I_Gotta_Do">
It seems like every time I come around, You say jay where have u been
Cos you can't get your mind off all, The things you hear from your friends …….whoooa
Well I don't give a damn, cos they don't understand, the things that we… do ……… whooaa
They don't even know me, how the going to know what's best for you
So I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get thru to you , I'm yours no doubt
I do what I gotta do, I'm trying to get thru to you, right here right now
Living in the city ,it can be so hard to stay on your feet
A girl that why it's good to know that I'm there for you and your there for me
While were trying to get that paper it's a struggle just for us to get by
But if we stick together we gon' make it baby we'll be alright
I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get thru to you I'm yours no doubt
I do what I gotta do, I'm trying to get thru to you, right here right now
I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get thru to you I'm yours no doubt
I do what I gotta do, I'm trying to get thru to you, right here right now
I've got you babe
I've got you baby
I hold you down ……..
And I do what I gotta do ……
I'm yours right now ………..
I gotcha ya baby
I gotcha ya baby
I hold you down …….yeaaaaaa
I do what I gotta do ….. heyyaaaa
I'm yours right now
