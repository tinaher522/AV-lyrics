Yay yay yay yay yay

Ok I see you checking me out
I think I know what you winking about
You with your man you don't want him to see
It's alright with me
I know I drink a little bit much
And you think Im talking crazy and such
I can't walk straight but girl I can see
You're alright with me
Alright, I see a little something that I like
You looking mighty fine in them skin tights
You know what I mean, It's alright with me
Hold up I know you got a man, but im tore up
And I dont even care if he roll up, with something to say
You better tell him he don't want it with me, It's alright
Yay yay yay yay yay
Yay yay yay yay yay
Yay yay yay yay yay
Yay yay yay yay yay
Good lord you got body for days
I think the way that you shake it's amazing
I got my keys if you ready to leave, It's alright with me
Now check your man 'cause he's going insane
He wanna know what the hell is my name
Now if he crazy enough to get in my face, It's alright with me
Alright, I see a little something that I like
You looking mighty fine in them skin tights
You know what i mean, It's alright with me
Hold up, I know you got a man, but im tore up
And I don't even care if he roll up, with something to say
You better tell him he don't want it with me
Say-a a, come on why don't you test me
If you want me come and get me
I'll show you who the best be, It's alright with me
I've watched you for a long time
I swear you lookin' alright
Come closer if you like what you see, It's alright with me
Alright, I see a little something that I like
You looking mighty fine in them skin tights
You know what I mean, It's alright with me
Hold up I know you got a man, but im tore up
And I dont even care if he roll up, with something to say
You better tell him he don't want it with me, It's alright
