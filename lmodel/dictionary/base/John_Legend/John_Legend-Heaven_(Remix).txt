<song artist="John_Legend" title="Heaven_(Remix)">
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Pusha T:
Pusha, John Legend, Heaven remix
I treat my best like my worst
The worst like my best
ThoseÂ ??? and louis vuittons clear my conscience
Pumps don't cover the pain of the nonsense
But it's a helluva band-aid, baby, honest
Far beyond this
Another broken promise
The nerve to expect forgiveness
with open arms is
never-ending drama
the soap opera grows
tell me where we go from here
heaven only knows
Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began
Before it here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go
Will I ever know
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we talking words
Drowned on by the sound
Let's get back to touching, we'll get back on solid ground
Let's hold hands
Like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love
Like way back in the day?
We can lose control, baby don't say "no"
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Will you come back to me?
Heaven only knows
Will you come back to me?
Pusha T:
Re-up Gang John Legend Heaven
Let me white coupe ya, unroof ya
Blow a kiss to the law 
let'em know that the sun suit ya
Ride the day out until the sky turn fuscia
Before you know it you wakin up to the roosters
i'm here to woo ya
they here to boo ya
You know he (pay ya)?
A little prada shoe or two ya
I myself will have you sittin with the jeweler
and leave there lookin like you were sittin in a cooler
Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
