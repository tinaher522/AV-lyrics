<song artist="John_Legend" title="All_Of_Me_(TiÃ«sto's_Birthday_Treatment_Remix)">
What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in and you kicking me out?
Got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all...
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, this ringing in my head for you
My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all 
All...
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all, all of you
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all, all of you
