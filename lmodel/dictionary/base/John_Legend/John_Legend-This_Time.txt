<song artist="John_Legend" title="This_Time">
Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
Its starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realize I made a mistake
I thought that I needed some space
But i just let love go to waste
Its so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
I gotta get you back today
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time Ill take the chance
This time Ill be your man
I can be all you need
This time its all of me
I hit the bar every night
looking to score a good time
Its not like I planned it
Left empty handed
Cause Im still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can i come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can i do now
Cause i need you back by my side
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time Ill take the chance
This time Ill be your man
I can be all you need
This time its all of me
Last time I wasnt sure.
This time i will give you more
Im more mature
Ill show you
Last time i didnt know
I messed up let her let you go
I need you, dont say no
Laying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Wont you come home
This time i want it all
This time i want it all
I' m showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time Ill take the chance
This time Ill be your man
I can be all you need
This time its all of me
All of me
