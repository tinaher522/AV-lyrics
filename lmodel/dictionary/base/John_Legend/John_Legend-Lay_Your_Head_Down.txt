<song artist="John_Legend" title="Lay_Your_Head_Down">
Lay your head on my shoulder
It'll be alright in the morning
Oh yes it will
Said I'll try to ease your pain
I'll hold your hand through stormy weather
Oh yes I will, yes I will
Lay your head on my shoulder
Be by your side, I'll make it better
Don't you hear me love
Like a knight in shining armour
I'll save the day cause you're my lover
Don't you hear me hey, hey
Lay your head on my shoulder
I'll hold you tight even if it takes me all night
Dry your eyes please don't cry
I'll wipe your tears just to see you smile
Even if it's for a little while
Tender heart don't let your world fall apart
Darlin' please believe there's more to life than what you see
Lay your head on my shoulder
It'll be alright in the morning
Oh yes it will
Said I'll try to ease your pain
I'll hold your hand through stormy weather
Oh yes I will
Yes I will
Oh yes I will
