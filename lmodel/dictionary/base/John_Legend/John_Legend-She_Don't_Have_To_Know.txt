<song artist="John_Legend" title="She_Don't_Have_To_Know">
Oohhhhhhh stealing moments just to be with you 
Though its wrong its hard to tell the truth 
Oh No she don't have to know 
She don't have to know 
When I meet cha 
I got my shades on to cover up my eyes 
I'm hoping that nobody sees me passing by 
Through my disguise 
I still know... you recognize 
But you 
I know you got a lilltle secret of your own 
You Sneaking out with me while your mans at home 
You know your wrong 
But it's so strong ,still carrying on 
I goooooooooooo
To the other side of town so I 
Will never risk the chance of catching her eye  oh no
she don't have to know 
She don't have to know 
And Ooohhhh 
Girl I know your doing the same thing too 
But I wont tell your man the things we do (oh no )
He don't have to know 
He don't have to know 
Someone's watching 
We got to be careful next time or we're through  ( PAUSE)
Damn it's so stressful doing the dirt we do 
So sad but true 
And I know one day 
I'm going to pay 
Then you ask me 
To sneak out of town for just a day or three 
let'sGo to DC and hold hands publicly 
All through the streets 
Cause they don't know you and they don't know me 
Hey and oh Ohhhhhh 
Ill feel sorry for mistake we've made 
But there's no reason that we should tell her today 
she don't have to know, she don't have to know
And Ohhhhh 
Though you give a lot of love to me 
Girl I know I'm not the only one you see 
But he don't have to know 
He don't have to know 

Ohm its getting crazy 
I don't want to hurt my baby 
And I know its supposed to be the last time for you and I 
But let's not end this way 
Wait another day.
