<song artist="John_Legend" title="Slide_Show">
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey , when I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came out from nothing , all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle, no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that, right or wrong, I'm a call it how I see it
Don't forget that impossible is nothing, you're environment is irrelevant
Just don't let your emotions over power your intelligent
Refuse to give up, your mistakes will define you
Down dictate where you heading, then remind you
That time keeps ticking, let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking, be aware of your decision
Be aware of the collisions
And the potholes hidin' in the road that you travel on your lifelong mission
Just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken,
If you live you could learn to just be patient
[Chorus]
Cause life is like a slide show
And all the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows
Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You cant take away from me
Cause life is like a slide show
As I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream, look where I took that
Beginnin' on Bankhead, then I spread out
Vision in my head, all I had to do is to get it out
When I walked out of my house, and look at my street
All I see is the opportunity that lead me to truancy
I ain't really have a roll model to influence me
Uncle Joink, said next year it's just gonna be you in it
As a juvenile caught cases so fluently
Look at my life and learn from it, don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now,
How much better life it would have been if I slowed down
Maybe I have been Kanye, instead of seeing gun play
But god got a plan, I'll understand one day,
But one day of life like a snap shot is taken,
If you live you could learn to just be patient
[Chorus]
Looking back on my life time
See the slides go by
Time to wonder why
Looking back on where I've been
I remember when
You remember
[Chorus]
Cause life is like a slide show
Cause life is like a slide show
Have seen, have dreamed, oh life is like a slide show
