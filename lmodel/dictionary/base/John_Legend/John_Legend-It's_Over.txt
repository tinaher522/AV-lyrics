[Hook]
Now What Do You Keep Calling For
Its Over, Its Overrr [Repeat 2x]
[Verse 1]
(Its Over)
In The Back Of My Mind I Question Why I Keep Calling
I Guess Im Just Used To Getting My Way Im Spoiled
I Dont Wanna Be What You Want Me To Be
So When I Call You're Just Yelling At Me
(I'm Sorry It's My Fault)
Oooh &amp; The Clothes I Brought You Can Still Wear
Did You Store The Cards &amp; Teddy Bears
See There I Go Again Sticking My Nose
(I'm Sorry It's My Fault)
[Chorus]
Now What Do You Keep Calling For
Its Over, Its Overrr [Repeat 2x]
[Verse 2]
(It's Over)
Girl Talking To Myself In The Mirror Is Strange Enough
So You Gotta Know Sharing This With You Is Painful
You Know We Used To Talk About Our Future
(It Ain't Just All My Fault)(I Know, I Know We Used To Talk About It Babe)
So Say Goodbye To The Way The Leaves Would Fall
The Way We Stand In The Rain &amp; We Would Ball (We Would Cry)
Just Say Goodbye To The Walks &amp; Talks &amp; The Dogs In The Park
(&amp; It Ain't Just All My Fault)
[Chorus]
Now What Do You Keep Calling For
It's Over, It's Overrr [Repeat 2x]
[Kayne's Verse]
(It's Over)
We Lost A Four Leaf Clover
Dont Ask Why Shorty Be Over
News Flash Shorty We Over
We Like Def Jam &amp; Hova
We Like Bobby &amp; Whitney
Except Without The Kiddies
Like Pamela Anderson's Career
Except Without The Tittes
We Had Some Good Times Didn't We
I Know I Won't Forget That
But We Had Some Bad Times &amp;
That's Time I Wish I Could Get Back
We Could've Had It All
Now I Just I Just Don't Know
You Been Around Me Long Enough
To Know That Now It's Over.
[Chorus]
Now What Do You Keep Calling For
It's Over, It's Overrr [Repeat 2x]
[Vamp]
(It's Over) It's Nothing We Can Do With It
So You Might As Well Forget It (It's Over)
Like We Never Ever Did It (It's Overrr) [Repeat 4x]
