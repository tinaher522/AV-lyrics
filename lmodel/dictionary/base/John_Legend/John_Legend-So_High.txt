<song artist="John_Legend" title="So_High">
Baby since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasies what love could really be
Let's go to a place where only lovers go 
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of a cloud we're floating away
Ooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're so high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
So High
My shoes are scraping the sky
So High
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky
Maybe later we could go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And can't get much closer to god then where we are
We'll go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating way
Ooh this feels so crazy, oh this love is blazing
And baby we're so high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
So High
My shoes are scraping the sky
So High
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky
Oooh, yeah
Ooooo-ooh oh
Oooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're soo high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
Ooooh yeeaah
Mmmhaaaah ay
Yeah...
This is how love suppose to be
This is how, this is how love suppose to be
Let's go to the moon baby,oooh
Let's go to the moon baby, yeah
Let's go, go, let's go to the moon baby
So high
