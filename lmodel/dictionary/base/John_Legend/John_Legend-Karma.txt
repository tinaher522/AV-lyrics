<song artist="John_Legend" title="Karma">
When the universe connects us
I know this is karma
Stare at the sky, can't get out my bed
There's shadow's circling my head
Where's love, your love
In another life id i play this game
Leaving me alone with an empty frame
I fear the worst in me
But you know the best in me
'Cause you see, when I'm honest with honesty
I will stumble trough the darkness
Til we see the morning
Is this karma, can you hear me
My heart is singin'
Everything inside i wanna say
I think about you every single day
Is this karma, Come and dance
Like we did before i
Lost you, this is karma
My heart is singing
Everything inside i wanna say
Every step I'm taking day by day
When the universe connects us
I know this is karma
I can't get the image of you out of my mind
The edges of your body pushing up against mine
Breathing, breathing
There is a silence in my beating heart
A cause and effect that we can't discard
Is all of love a ploy, an energy decoy
'Cause you see, when I'm honest with honesty
That means crashing trough the mirror
Just to know what love is
Is this karma, Come and dance
Like we did before I
Lost you, this is karma
My heart is singing
Everything inside I wanna say
Every step I'm taking day by day
When the universe connects us
I know this is karma
