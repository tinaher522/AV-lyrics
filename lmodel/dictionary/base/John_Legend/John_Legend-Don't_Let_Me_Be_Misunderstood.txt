<song artist="John_Legend" title="Don't_Let_Me_Be_Misunderstood">
Baby, do you understand me now 
And sometimes you see a little mad 
Can always be an angel 
When every things goes wrong you seem to be bad 
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
Sometimes I'm so carefree 
With a joy that's hard to hide 
Most of the time 
I'm so full of worry 
And then you're bound to see my other side 
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
If I seem edgy, I want you to know 
I never mean to take it out on you 
Life has it's problems and I've got in more my share 
And that's one thing I never mean to do 
'cause I love you baby 
I'm just human 
Have thoughts like any one 
Sometimes I think I spend the rest of my life regretting 
Some simple thing that I have done 
(x4) 
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
