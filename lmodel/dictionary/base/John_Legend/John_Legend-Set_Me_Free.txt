<song artist="John_Legend" title="Set_Me_Free">
Late in the evening
City sleeping
All through the night
This feeling’s creeping on me
So ready
Soul is waiting
Body’s aching
Caught and imprisoned
My own making
I’m so, so ready
I’m so gone, come get me
Won’t you come?
Set me free
Make me yours again
(Free)
In your arms again
(Free)
Won’t you come and dance with me
Throw out the lifeline
I’ve been sinking
Going out of my mind
I’ve been thinking
If I could hold her
Make this storm blow over
Give me a taste of satisfaction
Oh, I need to learn her
I need her faster
I’m so wide open
Won’t you come right over?
Won’t you come?
Set me free
Make me yours again
(Free)
In your arms again
(Free)
Won’t you come and dance with me
I’ve been looking for a light
Let it shine
Let it shine
You’ve been running through my mind
All this time
All this time
Set me free
Free…
I feel like…
Oh, to be free…
