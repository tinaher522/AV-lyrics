I don't wanna be what you want me to be
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry, it's my fault
It's over
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
In the back of my mind, I question why I keep calling
I guess I'm just used to getting my way, I'm spoiled
I don't wanna be what you want me to be
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry, it's my fault
Oh, the clothes I bought, you can still wear
Did you store the cards and teddy bears?
Ooh, yeah
See, there I go again sticking my nose
I'm sorry, it's my fault
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
Girl, talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful
You know we used to talk about our future
(I know, I know, I know we used to talk about it, babe)
It ain't just all my fault
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall
The way we stand in the rain and we would bawl
(We would cry)
Just say goodbye to the walks and talks and the dark in the park
And it ain't just all my fault
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
We lost a four leaf clover, don't ask my shorty be over
News flash shorty we over, we like Def Jam and Hova
We like Bobby and Whitney, except without the kiddies
Um, and like Pam Anderson's career except without the titties
We had some good times didn't we? I know I won't forget that
But we had some bad times and that's time I wish I could get back
We could've had it all, but I guess we'll never know
You been around me long enough to know that now it's over
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(Now what do you keep standing there for?)
Now what do you keep calling for?
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
What do you keep calling for?
(It's over)
There's nothing we can do with it
(What do you keep calling for?)
So you might as well forget it
(What do you keep calling for?)
Like we never ever did it
(What do you keep calling for?)
Oh, it's over
(What do you keep calling for?)
There's nothing we can do with it
(What do you keep calling for?)
So you might as well forget it
(What do you keep calling for?)
Like we never ever did it
(What do you keep calling for?)
Oh, hey
(What do you keep calling for?)
There's nothing we can do with it
(What do you keep calling for?)
So you might as well forget it
(What do you keep calling for?)
Like we never ever did it
(What do you keep calling for?)
(What do you keep calling for?)
