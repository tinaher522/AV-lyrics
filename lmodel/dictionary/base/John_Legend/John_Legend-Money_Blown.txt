<song artist="John_Legend" title="Money_Blown">
Don't let it fool you brother
Beware of what you see
You've been consumed by all your visions of luxury
Betrayed your friends and burned the
Bridges that carry you
But when you need them later, they won't be there for you
You're so high now
You think you'll never fall
But when you come down, who will you call?
Whatcha gonna do when your money's blown
Your friends are gone and you're all alone
Now you barely hanging on with no one else to run to
You should know it won't make you whole
You gain the world but lose your soul
Spend your life in the search for dough
You'll find out it just won't save you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You think that having money brings joy and peace to you
But the pursuit of it might bring out the beast in you
Chase the American Dream but can't face reality
That what you're chasing only lasts temporarily
You're so high now
You think you'll never fall
But when you come down, who will you call?
Whatcha gonna do when your money's blown
Your friends are gone and you're all alone
Now you barely hanging on with no one else to run to
You should know it won't make you whole
You gain the world but lose your soul
Spend your life in the search for dough
You'll find out it just won't save you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah
Whatcha gonna do when your money's blown
Your friends are gone and you're all alone
Now you barely hanging on with no one else to run to
You should know it won't make you whole
You gain the world but lose your soul
Spend your life in the search for dough
You'll find out it just won't save you

Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to) ohhh
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) ohhh
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to)
Ooh you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) ohhh
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to)
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Heeyyyy
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere to run to (Nowhere to run to)
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Heyeeyeyey, yeah yeah
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to) ohhh, yeah, yeah
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Heeyyy, there's nowhere
[John Legend's vocals fade out]
Nowhere to run to
Just won't save you
Nowhere to run to
Just won't save you
