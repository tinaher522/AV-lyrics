Holla holla holla
Holla holla holla
Maybe, it's me, maybe I bore you
But no no, it's my fault 'cause I can't afford you
Maybe baby, Puffy, Jay-Z would all be better for you
'Cause all I could do is love you
Baby, when I used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of livin' this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realized that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla holla holla
Holla holla holla
Now maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss
But you are above cost, all I could do is love you
Baby, when I used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realized that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla holla holla
Holla holla holla
Now do you remember when I used to love you
Baby, no not any more, I don't love you
Ohh, I loved you
And you're gonna miss me now
Baby, when I used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
And I'm not gonna play the fool
No, I can't live this lie
And I can't justify
And I can't make you my wife
'Cause I don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla holla holla
(Not like I used to)
Holla holla holla
(Not like I used to)
Oh, I used to love you
(Used to love you)
Oh but I don't love you
(Baby, I don't, not any more)
(I don't love you)
Oh I used to love you
(Used to love you)
Oh but I don't love you
(I bet you miss me now 'cause I don't love you)
Oh I used to love you
(You're gonna miss me now 'cause I used to love you )
Oh but I don't love you
(I bet you miss me now 'cause I don't love you)
