Holla Holla Holla 
Holla Holla Holla 
Maybe, it's me, maybe I bore you
But no no, it's my fault,'cause I can't afford you
Maybe baby, Puffy,Jay-z
would all be better for you
'Cause all I can do is love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you, do anything you asked me to
But I tired of livin this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realized that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla Holla Holla 
Holla Holla Holla 
Maybe, I should rob somebody
So we could, live like Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss
But you are, above cost
'Cause all I could do was love you
Baby when I used to love you, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you, do anything you asked me to
But i'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realized that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla holla holla
Holla holla holla
Do you remember when I used to love you
Baby no not any more, love you
Ooohhhh, I love you
And you're gonna miss me now
Baby when I used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do, 
I went through the fire for you, and i'm not gonna play the fool
No I can't live this life, and I can't justify, and I can't make you my wife
'cause I don't love you
Not like I used to do
Holla holla holla
Holla holla holla
Oh I used to love you
Oh I used to love you
Oh but I don't love you
Oh but I don't love you
Oh but you're gonna miss me now
Baby when I used to love you, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you, do anything you asked me to
But i'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realized that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Hola Hola Hola 
Hola Hola Hola 
Oh I used to love u
Oh I used to love u
Oh but I don't love u
Oh but I don't love u
Oh but you're gonna miss me now
Oh but I don't love yyyooouuu
