<song artist="John_Legend" title="Dreams">
Baby it seems the time is never right
You gonna let tonight go by
It's crazy
But I'm still waiting
If I play my cards right
My love's gonna strive
Until then there's tonight
All I wanna do is 
Dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true
If I dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time when I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream 
When I dream, yes I dream
Dream, dream, dream
They say that dreams sometimes do come true
These stars shine so bright 
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quit
But I'm so glad that I can
Dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream 
Like lovers do
And it might come true
If I dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time when I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream of you
