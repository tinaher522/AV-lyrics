<song artist="John_Legend" title="Woke_Up_This_Morning">
Woke up this morning with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Woke up this morning with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Woke up this morning with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.
I'm walking and talking with my mind
Stayed on freedom
I'm walking and talking with my mind
Stayed on freedom
I'm walking and talking with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.
Ain't nothing wrong with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Oh, there ain't nothing wrong with keeping my mind
Stayed on freedom
There ain't nothing wrong with keeping your mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.
I'm singing and praying with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Yeah, I'm singing and praying with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.
