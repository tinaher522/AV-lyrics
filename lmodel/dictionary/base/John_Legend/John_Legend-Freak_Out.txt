<song artist="John_Legend" title="Freak_Out">
I know a place where the freaks go
High away only few know
When its late at night and the sound slows down we come out and play
You caught my eyes from a distance
At first you showed some resistance
I've got you now if you listen close i will lead the way
Chorus
Come on freak out to the music
Get open now listen to it
You loose your mind when you hear the sound that the base drum makes.
Dont stop no sleep in the morning
Just loose yourself in the moment
Come closer now 
We can both freak out till the break of day
I see you came with your 2 friends
Tell em leave you alone im your new friend
Imma hunt you now
When the night ends im gonna have my prey
Hush now and sneak in the corner
I can see your eyes that you wanna 
Where at the brink of euphoria now don't you turn away
Chorus
Come on freak out to the music
Get open now listen to it
You loose your mind when you hear the sound that the base drum makes
Dont stop no sleep in the morning
Just loose yourself in the moment
Come closer now 
We can both freak out till the break of day
Freak out ( i know you wanna )
Freak out ( im gonna make ya )
Freak out ( your gonna like it )
Chorus (x1)
