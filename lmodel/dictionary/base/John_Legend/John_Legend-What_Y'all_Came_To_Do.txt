<song artist="John_Legend" title="What_Y'all_Came_To_Do">
I been workin' graveyard shifts eight days and no breaks
This ain't livin', somethin's missing
Friday night the weekend's here, it's right on time
I'm gonna miss ya, with somethin' different
Ain't no time to waste, it's gettin' late
Let's show them what we can do
My work is done, weekend's just for fun
Get out of your seat, let's move
What y'all came to do?
Put on your dancin' shoes
Yeah we about to burn it up
Come on everybody burn it up
I ain't got nothin' to prove
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Yeah we about to turn it up
Come on everybody turn it up
I been down and back and forth
And side to side
And you're groovin'
Let's keep it movin'
All around the world
Let's get down tonight
You gotta use it
Before you lose it
Don't forget to treat each day
As if it were the last
Life's too short for the blues
Get your light to the fire
Get this party started right
It's time to break all of the rules
What y'all came to do?
Put on your dancin' shoes
Yeah we about to burn it up
Come on everybody burn it up
I ain't got nothin' to prove
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Yeah we about to turn it up
Come on everybody turn it up
While you got a chance
Get up and dance, yeah
All you got to do
Is get up and move
What y'all came to do?
Put on your dancin' shoes
Yeah we about to burn it up
Come on everybody burn it up
I ain't got nothin' to prove
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Yeah we about to turn it up
Come on everybody turn it up
What y'all came to do?
Put on your dancin' shoes
Yeah we about to burn it up
Come on everybody burn it up
I ain't got nothin' to prove
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Yeah we about to turn it up
Come on everybody turn it up
