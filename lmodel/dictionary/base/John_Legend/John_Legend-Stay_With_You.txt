<song artist="John_Legend" title="Stay_With_You">
We've been together for a while now
we're growing stronger everyday now
It feels so good and there is no doubt
I will stay with you 
As each morning brings sunrise
And the flowers bloom in springtime
On my lovin you can rely , yea
And I'll stay with you
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
When the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you... ohh oohh wooh 
Though relationships can get old
Have a tendency to grow cold
We have something like miracle
Yeah, I'll stay with you
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
When the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you
There will be heartaches and pains, yea yea
But through it all, we will remain.. heyyy 
In this life, we all know
Friends may come, and they may go
Through the years I know
I will stay
In the end I know that we'll find
Love so beautiful and divine
We'll be lovers for lifetime, yeah
And I'll stay with you
I will stay with you
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you
Oh Everything will be fine yea 
And I will stay with you
Through the end of time
I will stay with you
Ohh hohh woohh
