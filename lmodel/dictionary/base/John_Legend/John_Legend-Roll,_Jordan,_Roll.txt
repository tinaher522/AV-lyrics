<song artist="John_Legend" title="Roll,_Jordan,_Roll">
Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear Jordan roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear Jordan roll
My brother, you ought to been there
Yes, my Lord
A sitting in the kingdom
To see o' Jordan roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear Jordan roll
My mother, you ought to been there
Yes, my Lord
A sitting in the kingdom
To see o' Jordan roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear Jordan roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To see o' Jordan roll
