Where did my baby go
I wonder where she ran off too
I miss my baby so
I'm calling but I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go
I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)
I'm searching for the lover that I knew
have you see her
where did she go
feels like I just lost my only friend
Plains subsided colours faded
Love just got so complicated
Wished that I could see her smile again
So if you see her out there
Tell her I'm still here
Waiting for the date when she will reappear
Where did my baby go
I wonder where she ran off too
I miss my baby so
I'm calling but I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go
I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)
Maybe I was wrong and I
Ignored her for too long and I
Didn't even notice when she slipped away
Maybe while I lay fast asleep then
Out into the night she creeps
I'll leave the light on, so she'll come back someday
So if you see her out there, tell her it's not fair
That life's just not the same when she's not here
[2x]
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
Just what am I supposed to do?
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon 3x(get back soon)
