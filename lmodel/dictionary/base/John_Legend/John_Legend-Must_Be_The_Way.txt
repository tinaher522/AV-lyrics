<song artist="John_Legend" title="Must_Be_The_Way">
It must be the way
that U move inside my head
(yeah yeah)
or it must be the songs
that U sing to me in bed
(yeah yeah)
it must be the moon
and the sun that sets so red
(Yeah yeah)
or it could be the stars
when we're lying under them
(yeah, Yeah, yeah)
It must be the
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the way
It must be the
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the way
It must be the way
that with U I don't pretend
(No, no)
and it must be your skin
that when I touch it just drives me mad
or it must be the blues
that with U I never have
(no, no, no, no)
it's all those little things
(yeah)
that you do make me so glad
And I'm telling u that
(oh)
I wonder
just what it is to me that you do
but I say that
it doesn't matter
cuz all I know
is that there's something about you
(oh)
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the way
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the way
and I don't kno
what it i
baby that you do
but it must be the way
that keeps me fallin for you
It must be the
It must be the
It must be the
It must be the Way
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the Way
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the way
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the
it must be the way
