<song artist="John_Legend" title="Maxine's_Interlude">
Get back soon
Where are you now? 
Oh, get back soon
Maxine, oh where are you now? (Maxine)
Maxine, oh get back soon
(Where are you now?)
(Where are you now?)
Sometimes I wonder why she wouldn't stay
What I should have changed
Sometimes I wonder why it's been so long
What did I do wrong?
(Maxine, Maxine...)
Oh, where are you now?
Oh, where are you now?
Maxine...
