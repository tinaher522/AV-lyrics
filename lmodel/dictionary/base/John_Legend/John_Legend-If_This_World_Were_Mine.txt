[John Legend]
If this world were mine, I would place at your feet 
All that I own, you've been so good to me 
If this world were mine 
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees 
And you'd be always beside me, be all that I need 
If this world were mine, I'd give you anything 
[Imani Uzuri]
If this world were mine, I would make you a king 
With wealth untold you could have anything 
If this world were mine 
I'd give you each so sunny and blue 
And if you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine 
I'd give you anything 
[John Legend]
Oh baby, you're my inspiration 
And there's no hesitation 
When you want me, all you gotta do is call me 
[Imani Uzuri]
Oh baby, you are my constellation 
And I feel so much sensation 
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me 
[John Legend]
The way that you do 
[Imani]
Ooh, the way that you love me more 
[John]
The way that you do 
[Imani]
Ooh, the way that you love me
[John]
Every sky would be blue as long as you're loving me, baby 
[Imani]
When I'm here in your arms, life is so wonderful, my love 
[both]
0o 0o 0o 0o 0o 0o 0o 
Give me pretty loving, baby 
Give me pretty loving, honey 
Keep on loving me, baby 
0o 0o 0o 0o 0o 0o 0o 
You know I need you, honey
You know I need you, baby
Keep on loving me 
[John]
Loving me the way 
[Imani]
The way you do 
I love the way that you, the way that you 
You love me, baby
[2x]
[both] 
The world would be yours 
The world would be yours 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Keep on loving me 
Keep on loving me [4x]
[John]
The world would be yours 
[Imani]
If you believe...
