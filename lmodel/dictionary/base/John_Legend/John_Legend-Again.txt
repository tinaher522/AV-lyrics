<song artist="John_Legend" title="Again">
The first time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew
That it was wrong to do
I guess that's why I was drawn to you
The 2nd time leads to the 3rd, the 4th, the 7th time
I feel so alive, it won't last but it's alright
Pleading joy and fading ecstasy, here it goes again oh
Sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree, Sweet taste of sin.
And I'm doing it again; yes, I'm doing it again
Oh I'm doing it again, I said it would end but here it goes again.
This time you told me you saw me at the same hotel
You said you knew me well, and I had a familiar smell
You asked me: "How am I ever going to put my trust in you?"
Like you want me to, cause I know what you're prone to do
Accusations fly like bullets do, here it goes again oh
But you know me because you're doing it too
The cycle never ends, never ends
Oh you're doing it again
Yes you're doing it again
Oh you're doing it again
You said it would end but here it goes again
And again, and again
Damn I love you, but this is crazy
I have to fight you almost daily
We break up so fast
And we, we make up so passionately
Why can't we just trust each 
You can't hate me and be my lover
Passion ends, and pains begins, I come backâ€¦
And we're doing it again
Yes we're doing it again
Oh we're doing it again
We said it would end
but here it goes again
Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain
Saying things will change, you'll take away the pain
Then we flashback to the first time you put your spell on me
You envelope me, you feel good as hell to me
One moment leads to another few
Here it goes again oh
Oh leaving you is oh so hard to do
I just can't pretend, can't pretend
I keep doing it again, oh I'm doing it again
Yes I'm doing it again
I said it would end but here it goes again
Again
