<song artist="John_Legend" title="Without_You">
Nights a little darker now
Rain is falling harder now
The clock is moving slower while, I'm waiting for you
Was hoping you would call today
Hoping you could dull the pain
Wishing this could be the same
Same as they used to
You say that I let you down when I know its you
But I pay the price in the tears that I shed for you
Hope you come home again
Wish you come home again
I've tried to live without you that life doesn't make any sense
You've been gone so long
I've been wondering
Where did I go wrong
I don't know if I can make it without you
(oh no)
I don't think that I can make it without you
Oh no, yeah yeah
I stood there in the pouring rain
Watch you leave for work today
I wanted just to call your name
Just say something to you
I'm wondering how the hell you've been
If I can have a chance again
I could be a better man
Better for you
I can name a million things I can change for you
Just give me the chance I know I can handle you, ohh
Wish you come home again
So won't you come home again
Cause I've been so lost without you I can't bring this pain to an end
You've been gone so long
I've been wondering
Where did I go wrong
I don't know if I can make it without you
(oh no)
I don't think that I can make it without you
(Oh no), oh I'm telling you
You've been gone so long
I've been wondering
Where did I go wrong
I don't know if I can make it without you
(oh no)
I don't think that I can make it without you
Oh no, noooooooo
