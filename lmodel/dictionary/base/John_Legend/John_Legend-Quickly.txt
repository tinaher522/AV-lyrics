Quickly
Oh news said it
Oh yea
If I had twenty million dollars in a vault somewhere baby, it wouldn't matter anyway.
'Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I got to love you while I'm here baby
Did you know
The news said that the sky is falling, the globe is warming
My country warring, leaders are lying, time is running
lower and lower, baby, No where to go, oh I,
I know we just met but baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I... want you to love me like you know the world's about to end baby, quickly
You said you didn't even know my name, but
Told me that we might as well make ours the same
What do you think baby? (no time)
Vegas might as well be light years away, ohhh
We just better land on the stars before they come crashing down cause I heard the news say
The news said that the sky is falling, the globe is warming
My country warring, leaders are lying, time is running
lower and lower, baby, No where to go, oh I, 
I know we just met but baby could u love me quickly, quickly
I... want you to love me like you know the world is about to end baby, quickly
Yea that's right baby kiss me like the world is quaking
Do it like the earth is shaking
You got it baby, that's right lovely
Fill me like our time is sprinting faster running out on life.
I know we just met but could u love me quickly, quickly
(just met but could you love me quickly, quickly, hurry up and love me
I... want you to love me like you know the world's about to end baby, quickly
world's about to end baby, quickly,  whoa oh).
You barely know me baby but you gotta love me quickly
(But you gotta love me quickly, quickly, oh yea).
oh You gotta love me like you know the world's about to end baby, quickly yea (hey) 
oh you gotta love me oh love me, (oh you gotta love me,gotta love me right now), oh oh yea, (yea)like the world's about to end baby love me (quickly now) The news said the sky is falling, quickly now, (love me), Love me.
