<song artist="John_Legend" title="Ghetto_Dreams">
My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, I was whippin' the hard
I was gettin' the broads that like "who the hell is that"
I was dealing sacks, you looking at niggas that drove to hell and back.
Charismatic I was raised by a addict with money in the attic.
Got goons while you at it at
This present time I'm out of my mind and that's a habit,
Still got them waiting in line they gotta have
[Chorus]
Last night was the first night I got sleep
Tossing and turning for two or three weeks
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories
Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams
Cold sweats listenin' to the old sweat
One, two that's a ho check
Now for real, nigga this a whole check
Just bossin' around, polo sweats
Used to dream 'bout a bigger couch
Woke up in a bigger house, come on
Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count
[Chorus]
It's like the world stand still
Yesterday your little man got killed
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young 'cause the game's cold
Most niggas ain't know, or they just think slow
Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil
To the point down your ass when he see you
Let's take that needle, fill it with poison
Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
Ain't no honor among thieves is there nowadays
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so
Because every criminal I know is in the clink, yo
A nigga in the game right now
Must be working for them people cause that shit played out
I lay awake in my four corner room with the candles
