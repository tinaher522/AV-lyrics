<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="You're_Wondering_Now">
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you did behave
Curtain has fallen, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
Curtain has fallen, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you did behave
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
