<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Monkey_Man">
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Huggin' up to big monkey man
I never saw ya, I only heard of you
Huggin' up to big monkey man
It's your life, it's your life
Huggin' up to big monkey man
Now I know that now I understand
Huggin' up to big monkey man
La-la-la, la-la-la
Huggin' up to big monkey man
