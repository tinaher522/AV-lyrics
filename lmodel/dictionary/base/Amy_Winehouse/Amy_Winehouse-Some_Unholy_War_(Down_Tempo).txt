<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Some_Unholy_War_(Down_Tempo)">
If my man was fighting 
Some unholy war 
I would be behind him 
Straight shook up beside him 
With strength he didn't know 
It's you I'm fighting for 
He can't lose with me in tow 
I refuse to let him go 
At his side and drunk on pride 
We wait for the blow 
We put it in writing 
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor 
Justice done, 
Reciting my stomach standing still 
Like you're reading my will 
He still stands in spite of what his scars say 
I'll battle till this bitter finale 
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case 
Yes my man is fighting some unholy war 
I will stand beside you 
And who you dying for?
B - I would have died too 
I'd of liked to 
If my man was fighting 
Some unholy war 
If my man was fighting
