<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Some_Unholy_War">
If my man was fighting some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow
We put it in writing
But who you writing for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done, reciting
My stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case
Yes my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
Who you dying for
B - I would have died too 
I'd of liked to
If my man was fighting some unholy war 
If my man was fighting
