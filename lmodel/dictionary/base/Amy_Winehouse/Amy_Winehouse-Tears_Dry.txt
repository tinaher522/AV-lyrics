<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Tears_Dry">
All I can ever be to you,
Is a darkness that we knew,
And this regret I had to get accustomed to,
Once it was so right,
When we were at our high,
Waiting for you in the hotel at night,
I knew I hadn't met my match,
But every moment we could snatch,
I don't know why I got so attached,
It's my responsibility,
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away I have no capacity
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And in this grey, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own,
I don't understand,
Why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things at hand,
We could a never had it all,
We had to hit a wall,
So this is inevitable withdrawal,
Even if I stop wanting you,
A perspective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon,
I shouldn't play myself again,
I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men,
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own,
So we are history,
Your shadow covers me
The sky above,
A blaze only that lovers see
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own,
I wish I could say no regrets,
And no emotional debts,
And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets,
So we are history,
The shadow covers me,
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see,
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own,
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry
He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry.
