<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Halftime">
Simple, sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance
1-Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
Rhythm floods my heart
The melody, it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And I swallowed it whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with the bliss
Repeat 1
My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take, yeah
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache
Repeat 1
