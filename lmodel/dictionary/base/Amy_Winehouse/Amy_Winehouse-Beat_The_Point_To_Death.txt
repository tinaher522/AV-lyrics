<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Beat_The_Point_To_Death">
Make a name for myself
In different ways
All the while you will see
My songs of praise
How can I concentrate
When all the while my head
Throw me scenarios
So I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released
But nothing let em' know
And added to that I'm sick
Of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion
With my physical release
Chorus:
Can't help
But bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing
I'm wasting my breath
Can't help
But bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath
They everywhere I go
And I always stare
I justify attraction
By your hands
Your lips, your hair
And so although I always look
I know that I can't touch
And because I can only take
A full time man so much
And now I reached a point
Where I don't care anymore
It's a necessity
Just like it was before
Many says I ignore
The way my body aches
'Cause I'm the shit I earn
I can't look for my sins
Oh, oh, no
(Chorus)
Can't help
I can't help
But bring it up, no
But my
Nothing, no
Can't
I can't help, no, no
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath
(Chorus)
Can't help
But my
Can't help
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath
