<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Hey_Little_Rich_Girl">
I bought you a fur coat 
When you were 15
You wore it to the disco
When everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your low-cut dresses threw stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
Just living on dreams
A man in a bright light
Took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom
For a taste unknown
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
Hey little rich girl
You've been away for so long (oh)
And now little rich girl
I wrote you in this song (woo woh)
Hey little rich girl
Baby love has gone 
And now little rich girl
I know where you belong
At your dad's office party
All the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache
Cos the â€˜screen-star' was you
You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Just living on dreams
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
