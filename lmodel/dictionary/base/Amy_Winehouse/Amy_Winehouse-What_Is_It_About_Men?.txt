<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="What_Is_It_About_Men?">
Understand, once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hates
I can't help but demonstrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
An animal aggression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got, I want it all
It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men?"
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men? What is it 'bout men?"
I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thing
And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing
And I'll save my tears for uncovering my fears
Our behavioural patterns that stick over the years
'Cause it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men?"
Now my destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men?
Ooh, it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, "Now what is it 'bout men?"
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men? What is it 'bout men?"
