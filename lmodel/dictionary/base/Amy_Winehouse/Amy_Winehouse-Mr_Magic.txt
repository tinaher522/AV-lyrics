<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Mr_Magic">
Everyday I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school
(Mr. Magic) Take a toke
(Mr. Magic) Of my love
(Mr. Magic) I see you through the smoke
Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
'Cause you come naturally
(Mr. Magic) Take a toke
(Mr. Magic) Of my love, love, love
(Mr. Magic) I see you through the smoke
Laying on my bed
I reach out for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through
(Mr. Magic) Take a token
(Mr. Magic) Of my love
(Mr. Magic) I see you through the smoke
(Mr. Magic)
Waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear
