<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="The_Girl_From_Inpanema">
Olha que coisa mais linda
Mais cheia de graça
É ela a menina que vem e que
Passa, num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de
Ipanema
O seu balançado émais que um poema
Éa coisa mais linda que eu já vi
Passar
Ah, por que estou tão sozinho?
Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa
Sozinha.
Ah, se ela soubesse
Que, quando ela passa
O mundo inteirinho, se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor
Tall and tan and young
And lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes, ah
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes, each one she passes goes, aah
Ooh but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But instead when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at him
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, he smiles but she doesn't see
(Ooh)
But he sees her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at him
Tall, and tan, and young, and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, he smiles but she doesn't see
She just doesn't see
She just doesn't see
She just doesn't see
She just doesn't see
She just doesn't see
She just doesn't see
