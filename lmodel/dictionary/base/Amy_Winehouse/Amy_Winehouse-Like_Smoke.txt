Amy
I never wanted you to be my man
I just need your company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hung around in the unbalanced
Whoa
Whoa
Nas
It's not a movie, this is not a script or proofread
I'll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies 
Fun to punctuate, pronunciate the funds I make ? put in your face 
Oh my mistake, you're not a floosy? Then excuse me 
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3 
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary 
I kick the narrative, this is legendary 
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess 
I hold a lady's interest, I just met 
The love scholar, she the teacher's pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat 
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it 
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy 
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heart breaker 
Like smoke, girls lean 'round a player 
Yeah, yeah
Amy
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hang around in the unbalanced
Whoa
Yeah
Oh, oh, whoo
Oh
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
Nas
Yo, this recession is a test
It's affecting my complexion 
Misdirection my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me 
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly 
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG Those fly suites and my boojwazi 
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you're so deep
I said, no let's go through it
Historically so ruthless feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classify me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin poo, in her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy 
See a penguin, he drags his shit on the ground all day
And there's a dragon ? 
I'm through with you after I crush, so is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, "Yeah"
You know how me and Amy are straight players
Amy
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hang around in the unbalanced
Whoa
Oh
Ooh, oh
Hey
Oh, oh
Ooh
Oh
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
