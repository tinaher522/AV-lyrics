<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="It's_My_Party">
[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?
[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancing with me,
I've got no reason to smile
[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
[Instrumental Bridge]
Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring
[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
[repeat and fade out]
