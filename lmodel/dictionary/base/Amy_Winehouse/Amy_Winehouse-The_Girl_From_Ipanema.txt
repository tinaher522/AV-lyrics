<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="The_Girl_From_Ipanema">
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes
Goes ..
When she walks it's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes ..
Ooh! how I watch her so sadly
How, I cannot tell her love her
Yeah! I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and Tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes,
I go...
the girl the girl the girl from Ipanema
from Ipanema ...
 
Oh, Yeah I want her so badly 
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yeah, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walk to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and Tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes I smile but she doesn't see
She ain't looking at me
Oooh
