(feat. Paul Weller)
I bet you wonderin'
How I knew
'Bout your plans
To make me blue
With some other guy
You knew before
Between two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise
I must say
When I found you yesterday
Don't you know that
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Uhh, uhh
Heard it through
The grapevine
Oh
I'm just about
To lose my mind
Honey, honey
Oh, baby
Ooh ooh honey honey
I know a man
Ain't supposed to cry
But these tears
I can't hold inside
Losin' you
Would end my life
You see
Cause you mean
That much to me
You could have
Told me yourself
That you loved
Someone else
Instead
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Ohh
I heard it
Through the grapevine
And I'm just
About to lose my mind
Honey, honey
People say believe
Half of what you see
Oh, and none
Of what your hear
But I can't help
But be confused
If it's true
Please tell me dear
Do you plan
To let me go
For the other guy
You loved before?
