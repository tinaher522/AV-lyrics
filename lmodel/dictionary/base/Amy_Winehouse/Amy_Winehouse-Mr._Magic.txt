<song artist="Amy_Winehouse" title="Mr._Magic">
Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me
Stress me free point of view
Pick you up after school
(Mr Magic) Take a token
(Mr Magic) Of my love
(Mr Magic) I see you through the smoke
Without you, a misery
Blue with a migraine
All the songs sound better
When you're next to me
Hey, 'cuz they come naturally
(Mr Magic) Take a token
(Mr Magic) Of my love
(Mr Magic) I see you through the smoke
Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh
You even make the standards bloom
But its just to you through
(Mr Magic) Take a token
(Mr Magic) Of my love
(Mr Magic) I see you through the smoke
(Mr Magic)
(Mr Magic)
(Mr Magic)
Waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear
