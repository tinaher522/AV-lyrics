<song artist="Queen" title="Flash's_Theme_Reprise">
Yeah, he's for everyone of us
Stand for everyone of us
He'll save with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman, every child
He's the mighty flash
{[Incomprehensible] everything to Flash, hail flash
From this day on every breed of Mongo live together in peace, hail Flash
Will we ever get out of here [Incomprehensible]?
I don't know, but we'll try
[Incomprehensible] invite you all to stay, what do you think?
I am New York City girl, it's a little too quite around here for me}
