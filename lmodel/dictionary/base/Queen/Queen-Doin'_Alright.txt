<song artist="Queen" title="Doin'_Alright">
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doin'
Gotta feelin' I should be doin' alright
Doin' alright
Where will I be this time tomorrow
Jumping with joy or sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doin' alright
Doin' alright
Should be waiting for the sun
Anyway I've got to hide
Going back to where the skies are blue
Going home to find the one
