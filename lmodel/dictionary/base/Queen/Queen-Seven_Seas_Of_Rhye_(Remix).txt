<song artist="Queen" title="Seven_Seas_Of_Rhye_(Remix)">
Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
bring before me what is mine
the seven seas of rhye
can you hear me you peers and privvy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
the seven seas of rhye
sister - I live and lie for you
mister - do and I'll die

you are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever
storm the master-marathon I'll fly through
by flash and thunder-fire I'll survive
then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
then I'll get you
be gone with you - you shod and shady senators
give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
and with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of rhye
