<song artist="Queen" title="These_Are_The_Days_Of_Our_Lives">
Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know?
The days were endless
We were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining, we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don’t know
The rest of my life’s been just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now
But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can’t turn back the clock
You can’t turn back the tide, ain’t that a shame?
Ooh, I’d like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting 
And thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don’t know
Better sit back and go with the flow
‘Cause these are the days of our lives
They’ve flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now
But one thing’s still true
When I look and I find I still love you
I still love you
