<song artist="Queen" title="Hello_Mary_Lou_(Goodbye_Heart)">
I said "Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou 
I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oo I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
I swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did see you before
I said "Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou 
I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
