<song artist="Queen" title="You_And_I">
Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering
My heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No no no
Come tomorrow
Cos then we'll be waiting for the moonlight
We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay awhile
You know I never could forsee the future years
You know I never could see where life was leading me
But will we be together for ever,
What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know
No no not tonight
Come tomorrow
Everything's gonna be fine (sunny and bright)
Wait and see 
If tomorrow
we'll be as happy as we're feeling tonight
We'll go walking in the moonlight (oh, we'll be happy, we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight
I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight (Just you and I) 
Just you and I
Just you and I
Can't you see that we've gotta be together
Be together, just you and I, just you and I
No more questions, just you and I
