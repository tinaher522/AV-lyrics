<song artist="Queen" title="Big_Spender">
The minute you walked in the joint,
I could see you were a man of
distinction,
A real big spender,
good looking, so refined,
so wouldn't you like to know
what's going on in my mind,
So let me get right to the point,
I don't pop my cork for every man
I see,
Hey Big Spender,
Spend a little time with me
Wouldn't you like to have fun,
fun, fun,
how about a few laughs,laughs, laughs,
I could show you a fun, laughs, good times, 
fun, laughs, good times,
fun, laughs, good times,
Hey big spender,
Spend a little time with me
The minute you walked in the joint,
I could see you were a man of 
distinction,
A real big spender,
Good looking so refined,
wouldn't you like to know, 
whats going on in my mind,
So let me get right to the point, 
I don't pop my cork for every man 
I see,
Hey Big Spender,
Hey Big Spender,
Hey Big Spender,
Spend a little time with me.
