Words and music by Queen
This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Yeah yeah yeah
Here we go
Tellin' lies
Here we go (here we go)
This is the way we are today
oh ho oh ho
We're right back were we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray - hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page oh
Oh Lord I thank you for my
My life has been saved
My life
My life has been saved
My life
My life
My life has been saved
I'm in no doubt
I'm blind
I don't know what's coming to me
