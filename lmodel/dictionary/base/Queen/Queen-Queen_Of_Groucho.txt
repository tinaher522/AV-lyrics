<song artist="Queen" title="Queen_Of_Groucho">
You look at me every day.
You look at me, and what do you say?
You say, lookey there! It's the queen!
It's the Queen of Groucho!
You stand there gaping at the queen,
Hopin' for an autograph.
The queen says, no, sir, I refuse.
I'm the Queen of Groucho!!!
DEATH TO THE QUEEN!!!
DEATH TO THE QUEEN!!!
DEATH TO THE QUEEN OF GROUCHO!!!
DEATH TO THE QUEEN!!!
DEATH TO THE QUEEN!!!
DEATH TO THE QUEEN OF GROUCHO!!!
I am the Queen of Groucho,
Though I just pretend to be.
I'm really the King of Sloucho,
And now I have to pee
AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH...
