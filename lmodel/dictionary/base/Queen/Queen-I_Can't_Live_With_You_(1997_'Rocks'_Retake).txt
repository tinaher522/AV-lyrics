I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh Ohhh
I Can't
Yeah
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Oooh, but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to
Get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe - if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you, I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live, I just can't live
Ooh, I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness, through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years
Yeah, ooh yeah, yeah
I can't live without you - eh yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah eah yeah
Whoa whooooa
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Whoa
I can't live without you
Baby baby baby
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Ma ma ma ma ma whoa whoooa yeah
Yeah
