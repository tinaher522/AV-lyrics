<song artist="Queen" title="We_Will_Rock_You_(Fast_Version)">
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playing in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on yo' face
Big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place
We will we will rock you (come on)
We will we will--
Buddy you're a young man hard man
Shouting in the street gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on yo' face
A big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place
We will we will rock you (sing it everyone)
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you (come on)
We will we will--
Buddy you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day
Got mud on yo' face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place
We will we will rock you (yeah yeah)
We will we will--
Rock you, rock you, rock you, rock you
We will we will rock you
Rock you!
spoken, beginning Queen:Let Me Entertain You
Hello everybody, feeling good?
Are you ready to rock? Are you ready to roll?
