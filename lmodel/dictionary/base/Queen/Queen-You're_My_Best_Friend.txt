<song artist="Queen" title="You're_My_Best_Friend">
Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know that my feelings are true
I really love you
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round
Still come back to you (Still come back to you)
In rain or shine you've stood by me, girl
I'm happy at home (Happy at home)
You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the first one when things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Oh, you're my best friend
Oh, ooh, you make me live
Live, live, live
(I'm happy, happy at home)
You're my best friend
Oh
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, you're my best friend
