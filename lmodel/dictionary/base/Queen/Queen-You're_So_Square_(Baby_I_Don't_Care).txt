<song artist="Queen" title="You're_So_Square_(Baby_I_Don't_Care)">
Okay, we're gonna fool around a bit, come on
You don't like crazy things
You don't like rockin' baby
You just wanna go to the movie show
Sit there holdin' hands
You're so square (baby I don't care)
Do wop, do wop
Do wop, do wop
I don't ???? (do wop)
I don't ???? (do wop)
I only wanna love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square (baby I don't care)
Do wop, do wop
Do wop, do wop
I don't need ??? dances
But I do
????
???
I do I do I do
I don't like crazy things (do wop)
I don't like rockin' baby (do wop)
I just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there holdin' hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Hey
