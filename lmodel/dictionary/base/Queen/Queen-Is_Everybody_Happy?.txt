<song artist="Queen" title="Is_Everybody_Happy?">
Words by Freddie Mercury and Mike Moran 
Is everybody happy? 
Is everybody really feeling good 
I'm sorry I couldn't be there, I'm recording in a studio all night long 
So take it easy everyone, have a nice day bye bye, yeah 
Mike Moran on the piano
