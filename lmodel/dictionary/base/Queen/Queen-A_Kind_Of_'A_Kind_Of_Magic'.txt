Magic (magic)
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done - (done)
(Magic) - It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic, magic, magic, magic (magic)
(Magic) ha ha ha haa - it's magic
(Magic)
Yeah - it's a kind of magic
Ha haa

Wooh
It's a kind of magic
