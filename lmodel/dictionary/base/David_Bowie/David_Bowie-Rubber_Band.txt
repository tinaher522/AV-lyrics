<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Rubber_Band">
Rubber Band 
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune 
In the library garden Sunday afternoon 
While a little chappie waves a golden wand 
Rubber Band 
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong 
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long 
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes 
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh 
Rubber Band 
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea 
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon 
Oh, play that theme 
Rubber Band 
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band 
We could play in library parks throughout the land 
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love 
Rubber Band 
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea 
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me 
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh 
(spoken) 
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton
