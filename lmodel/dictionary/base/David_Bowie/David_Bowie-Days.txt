- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 
Hold me tight 
Keep me cool 
Going mad 
Don't know what to do 
Do I need a friend? 
Well I need one now 
All the days of my life 
All the days of my life 
All the days I owe you 
All I've done 
I've done for me 
All you gave 
You gave for free 
I gave nothing in return 
And theres little left of me 
All the days of my life 
All the days of my life 
All the days I owe you 
With redeyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my faded heart
I'll play your sooth my sorry soul 
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life) 
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life) 
All the days I owe you 
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life) 
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life) 
All the days I owe you 
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life) 
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life) 
All the days I owe you 
All the days of my life
