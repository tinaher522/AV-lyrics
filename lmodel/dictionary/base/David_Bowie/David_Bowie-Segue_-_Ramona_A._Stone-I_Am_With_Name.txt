SEGUE: RAMONA A. STONE
Spoken
I was 
Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artist
In a tunnel
But I've been having a mid-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are
SONG: I AM WITH NAME
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name 
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say: twitch &amp; stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female good time drone
I am with name 
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say: 
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am Ramona A. Stone
[Give it to me one more time!]
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descending
