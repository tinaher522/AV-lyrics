<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Fascination">
Got to use her
Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to
Use her
Every time I think of what she pulled me through, dear
Fascination moves sweeping near me
Still I take ya
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho 'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) takes
A part of me
(Can a heart-beat) can a heart-beat
(Live in a fever) live in a fever?
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh yeah
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) got to use her
(Every time, ooh)
Fascination comes around
(Ooh-oo-ooh)
(Fascination) Your soul is calling
Like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn
I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think
That I'm a little crazy
Ohh, better sex is fun
I think I like fascination
Still, tick
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho 'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) takes
A part of me
(Can a heart-beat) can a heart-beat
(Live in a fever) live in a fever?
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh yeah
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) got to use her
(Every time, ooh)
Fascination comes around
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho 'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) takes
A part of me
(Can a heart-beat) can a heart-beat
(Live in a fever) live in a fever?
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh yeah
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) got to use her
(Every time, ooh)
Fascination comes around
