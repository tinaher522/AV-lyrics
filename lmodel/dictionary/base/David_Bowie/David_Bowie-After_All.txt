<song artist="David_Bowie" title="After_All">
Please trip them gently
They don't like to fall (Oh by jingo)
There's no room for anger
We're all very small (Oh by jingo)
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies
From paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite the
They're just taller children
That's all
After all
Man is an obstacle, 
Sad as the clown (Oh by jingo)
So hold on to nothing
And he won't let you down (Oh by jingo)
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running
The smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence
They're just older children
That's all
After all
I sing with impertinence
Shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred
That we're nobody's children
At all
After all
Live till your rebirth
And do what you will (Oh by jingo)
Forget all I've said 
Please bear me no ill (Oh by jingo)
After all
After all
