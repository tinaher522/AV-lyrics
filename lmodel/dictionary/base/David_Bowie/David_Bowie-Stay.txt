<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Stay">
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
