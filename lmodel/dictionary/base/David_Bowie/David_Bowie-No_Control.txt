<song artist="David_Bowie" title="No_Control">
Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged - no control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore would not bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in fallen leaves
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged - no control
I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
Forbidden words, deafen me
In memory,  no control
See how far a sinful man
Burned his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged
