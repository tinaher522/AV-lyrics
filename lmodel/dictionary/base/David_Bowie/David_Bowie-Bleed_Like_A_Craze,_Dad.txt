Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Bleeds like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Easy come, come, gotta back
In the valley of the dead man walks
How they drank from the jazz
Astral, Kestrel
Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pedestal
Carving you will never get
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about
Hollywood King Kong
Domino on the side
Street light, looking right
Looking to the parlous parlours
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Blee-eed, bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Living on a movie
All the Shirley/Charley films on film
Come together, party
Footnote on the footstone
Shine shine shine
Bleeds like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
