<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Liza_Jane">
Well, I got a girl that's so good to me
(Oh, little Liza)
Well, now she ain't more than five foot three
(Oh, little Liza)
Well, this little girl is so good to me
(Oh, little Liza)
Yeah, this little girl's nearly half of me
(Oh, little Liza)
Little Liza Jane
I got a girl, duh-duh-goo-to-duh
(Oh, little Liza)
Yeah, this little girl turn me upside down
(Oh, little Liza)
Well, all of the little girls that I had
(Oh, little Liza)
You know this little girl drives me to despair
(Oh, little Liza)
Little Liza Jane
Yeah, I got a girl who loves me true
(Oh, little Liza)
Now she ain't more than five foot two, yeah
(Oh, little Liza)
You know this little girl is so good for me, yeah
(Oh, little Liza)
You know this little girl's nearly half of me
(Oh, little Liza)
Little Liza Jane
Oh yeah, I love her
Little Liza Jane
Well, I'm coming back to me love
'Cause she's driving insane
When will I meet her
