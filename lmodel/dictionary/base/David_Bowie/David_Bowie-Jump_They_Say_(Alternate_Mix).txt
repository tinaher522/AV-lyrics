<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Jump_They_Say_(Alternate_Mix)">
When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire
They say
They say
They say
he has no brain
They say
he has no mood
They say
he was born again
They say
look at him climb
They say 'Jump'
They say 'Jump'
They say 
he has two gods
They say 
he has no fear
They say he has no eyes
They say 
he has no mouth
They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'Jump'
They say 'Jump'
Watch out
Watch out
They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'Jump'
Juuuuummmppp
Got to believe somebody
They say 'Jump'
Juuuuummmppp
Got to believe somebody
They say 'Jump'
Juuuuummmppp
Got to believe
They say 'Jump'
Juuuuummmppp
Got to believe somebody
'Jump'
Got to believe
'Jump'
Got to believe somebody
'Jump'
Juuuuummmppp
Got to believe
'Jump'
Juuuuummmppp
Got to believe somebody
'Jump'
They say 'Jump'
