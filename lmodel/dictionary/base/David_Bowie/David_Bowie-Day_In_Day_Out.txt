<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Day_In_Day_Out">
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
She was born in a handbag, love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup, nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey, try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey, she's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town, police, shake down
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
She's in the pocket of a home boy
Ooh she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin' her with video-drugs-bullets and promises
