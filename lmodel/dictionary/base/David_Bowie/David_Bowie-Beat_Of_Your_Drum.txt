<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Beat_Of_Your_Drum">
Photograph king, watches you go
Now fashions may change, heaven knows, but you
still leave a stain on me
Only to go colours may fade
The seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me
Wrong-negative fades-never the twain, reckless and tame
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look thru your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I beat it I beat I beat it
I feel it
Disco brat-follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all this greedy intention
Only to go-I picture you now
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose
Wrong-love out of tune
Sweet is the night, bright light destroys me
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look thru your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I beat it I beat Can't beat it
I feel it
I like to beat on your drum
I like to beat on your drum
I like your face in the crowd
I like to beat on your drum
I beat it I beat Can't beat it
I feel it
Can't beat it
I feel it
Ho beat it
I beat it
Oh yeah
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to yell it out loud 
I'd like to beat on your drum
Can't beat it can't beat it
I feel it I feel it
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
Yeah yeah yeah
Can't beat it 
Can't beat it
I be there
Baet it all out
Beat it all in the crowd
Beat it beat it beat it beat it
I feel it I feel it
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to blow your horne
I'd like to beat on your drum
Yeah yeah yeah
Ahhhhhh
