<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Memory_Of_A_Free_Festival">
Maybe I should announce it, should i
Memory of a free festival
The children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the london sky
Resting on our hands
It was god's land
It was ragged and naive
It was heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon

And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall venusians passing through
And peter tried to climb aboard but the captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road, unchained
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ha ha ha
(repeat 25 times)
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, yeah yeah
The sun machine is coming down, woh ho ho
Sun machine is coming down, oh oh oh ah
Sun machine is coming down, oh
