<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Untitled_No._1">
In mornings she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slows
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides 
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls
Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take
Shimi Kapoor
Please heal these tears
Shimi Kapoor 
She will feel like at tea make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Ooh lady, ooh baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up up up up oh ah
Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take
Shimi Kapoor
Please heal these tears
Shimi Kapoor 
Shimi Kapoor 
Shimi Kapoor 
Shimi Kapoor 
Shimi Kapoor 
Please heal these tears
Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take
Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never
Shimi Kapoor 
Please heal these tears
Ah how
Shimi Kapoor 
Ah how
Some things never
Shimi Kapoor 
Ah how
Never never
