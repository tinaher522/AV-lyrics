<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Shining_Star_(Makin'_My_Love)">
Eddie boy lit like paraffin spending two weeks in a crack house
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl
Dean was seen with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone to pray for-till I met you
Life is like a broken arrow
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy every day of your life
Making my love like a shining star
takin' my love just a touch too far
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say
Nobody cares what you do
please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a
bet you'll never find a better man.
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far
Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky,
Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover this page with depts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs 
threw it all away
Have a life in the grave
Have a life in the grave
Life is like a broken arrow
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
Well I could make you happy every goddamn single day of your life
Making my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Babe that's what you are
Like a shining star
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
