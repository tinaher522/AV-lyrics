<song artist="David_Bowie" title="I'm_Waiting_For_The_Man">
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Hey white boy, what you doin' in town
Hey white boy, chasin' all the women around
Oh pardon me, sir, it's the last thing on my mind
I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Real shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for the man
Big dirty building, up three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split because he's got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man
Baby, don't you holler, darlin', don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Waiting for the man
To welcome me home
