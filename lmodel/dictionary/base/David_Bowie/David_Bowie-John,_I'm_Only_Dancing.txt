<song artist="David_Bowie" title="John,_I'm_Only_Dancing">
Well, Annie's pretty neat
She always eats her meat
And Joe is awful strong
Bet your life he's puttin' us on
Oh, lordy 
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Oh, shadow love was quick and lean
Life's a well-thumbed machine
I saw you watchin' from the stairs
You're everyone that ever cared
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Dancing
Won't someone touch me
Touch me
Ooh
