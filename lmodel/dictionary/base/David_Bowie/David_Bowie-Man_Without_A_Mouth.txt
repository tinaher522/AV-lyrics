<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Man_Without_A_Mouth">
In the morning, sounds the alarm
Is it a warning of all the things to come?
On my pillow, there is blood
I try to speak but only think a word
Reflecting windows, by the sun
My mouth is gone.
Well damn the songs I'd sung if I had know, my mouth is gone
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name.
When a man without a mouth wants to speak, he's got things to say
In my car, I hum the tune along, to a radio song.
When I go to work, it's just like this.
Except there's no smile for the receptionist.
Except I can't smoke my cigarette.
When the boss says I'm late I can't say back its metamorphosis
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name
When a man without a mouth wants to speak
He's got things to say
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name
