<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Wolf">
No sooner had Peter gone, than a big grey wolf came out of the forest.
In a twinkling the cat climbed up into the tree.
The duck quacked, and in her excitement jumped out of the pond.
But no matter how hard the duck tried to run, she couldn't escape the wolf.
He was getting nearer, nearer, catching up with her.
