<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Tvc_1_5">
Up every evenin' 'bout half eight or nine I give my
Complete attention to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a he's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5
I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC 1 5, baby's gone, yeah
She crawled right in, oh my, she crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5, oh, so demonic, oh my TVC 1 5
Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
"Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature"
My TVC 1 5, he, he just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5
One of these nights I may just jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then, we'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5
My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5
Transition, transmission
Transition, transmission
Oh my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
"Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature"
My TVC 1 5, he, he just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5
One of these nights I may just jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then, we'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5
My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky
So hologramic, oh my TVC 1 5
Transition, transmission
Transition, transmission
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
Oh, my TVC 1 5, oh oh, TVC 1 5
