<song artist="David_Bowie" title="We_Are_Hungry_Men">
Here is the news:
According to the latest world population survey,
Figures have reached danger point, my god!
London: 15 million 75 thousand.
New York: 80 million.
Paris: 15 million and 30.
China: 1000 million.
Billington-Spa: lots!
My studies include exophagy.
I formed my own society,
To crush the power of fecundity.
The world will overpopulate,
Unless you claim infertility.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible.
The crops of few, the cattle gun.
There's only one way to linger on.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
Achtung, achtung! These are your orders:
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated.
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
I've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide.
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
You don't seem to hear me clear.
Do I talk above your sphere? 
Let me explain my project, dear,
Show you how I'll save the world,
Or let it die within the year.
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
We are hungry men.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to eat you.
