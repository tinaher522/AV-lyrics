<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Like_A_Rocket_Man">
Little Wendy Cocaine stumbles up the hill to pain
 Nothing stops the go-to girl, nothing takes the place of taking aim
 Little Wendy's out there shaking hips and cuckoo eyes
 CRAZY DRIVES THAT DIZZY CROWD
 Moonlight strokes the highlights in her hair
 She sells and moves and finds my hand 
 And pulls me down and close so I can hardly stand
 As I lay like dead for her, I'm fed into my head I'm led, oh, I am Sam
 I'm crawling from the window, crawling down the wall
 I'M HAPPY SCREAMING, YES, I AM
 I'm jumping on her daisy chain
 I'm speeding through the dancehall like a rocket man
 Now I wish today that yesterday was just tomorrow and
 I COULD SQUEEZE HER GRABBY HAND
 Knowing that I never paid her for a gram
 She's a drunken doxy off her trolly 
 Sent before her time into this poxy world
 She's not fit for anything but dealing it 
 While heaven sings, I have this girl
 SHE'S GOT ME EATING RICE AND BEANS
 I have no shape nor color, I'm God's lonely man
 I don't want to die but I don't want to live
 I'M SPEEDING LIKE A ROCKET MAN
 Like a rocket man
 Like a rocket man
 Like a rocket man
