<song artist="David_Bowie" title="I've_Been_Waiting_For_You">
I've been looking (I've been looking)
I've been looking (I've been looking)
I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be, be tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now.
A woman with the feeling, losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be, be tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now.
For such a long time now
For such a long time now.
