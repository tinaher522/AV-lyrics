<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Back_On_The_Chain_Gang">
I found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
You had hijacked my world at night
To a place in the past we've been passed out of, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Now we're back in the fight
We're back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)
Circumstance beyond our control, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
The phone, TV and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from Hell, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies
And put us back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)
The powers that be
That force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you
Well, I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day
For making us part
I found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart
Now I'm back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)
