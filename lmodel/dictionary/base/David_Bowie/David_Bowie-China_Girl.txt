<song artist="David_Bowie" title="China_Girl">
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "Shh."
She says, "Shh."
She says
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
