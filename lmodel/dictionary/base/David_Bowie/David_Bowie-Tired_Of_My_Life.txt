<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Tired_Of_My_Life">
I don't know why but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry
I don't believe but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bare
You don't perseve so I'm leading you away
Home were you've never been, non-returning

So cry
Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers
I don't know why but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking
