<song artist="David_Bowie" title="I_Pray,_Olé">
Let's say goodbye till tomorrow
With a word sincere
How do you make it through the night?
I hope to God you're still here, I pray Olé
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
I pray Olé
It's a God eat God world, it's a dog's tomorrow
And the song and the wind
Brings nothing but sorrow
I pray Olé, I pray Olé, I pray Olé
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it?
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
