<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Informer">
I took the job, I packed the bag
 I ride the train to the pick-up point
 I'll be telling myself
 There was no other way
 That you brought it on yourself
 Now my heart's aflame
 At the end of your life
 IT'S THE END OF YOUR LIFE
 I've got a pool of blood
 On this bathroom floor
 The mirror's broke
 There's a crack in the door
 There's a broken window
 That I'll be crawling through
 Then I've changed my life
 And we won't have you
 We won't have you
 NO, WE WON'T HAVE YOU 
 Good or evil
 Saint or whore
 Domestic or public
 I don't recall
 You were on the ledger
 Your name was double crossed
 You were the prime assignment
 SO HELP ME CHRIST
 I've got major questions
 About the Lord above
 About Satan below
 About the way we love
 About the rule at the top
 And the people coming up
 And I still don't know
 What we were looking for
 But it wasn't you
 No, it wasn't you
 NO, IT WASN'T YOU 
 It wasn't you
 No, it wasn't
