I don't want knowledge
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty
In the streets
A man shouts out loud
A wallet drops
And money flies into the midday sun
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
Sure, I get a bit afraid -
Sometimes
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
Sure, I get a bit afraid -
Sometimes
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty
In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs:
"What a morning"
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
Sure, I get a little bit afraid -
Sometimes
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
Sure I get a little bit afraid -
Sometimes
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire (repeat to last verse as backing vocals)
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty 
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty 
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty 
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty 
I don't want knowledge
