<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Little_Toy_Soldier">
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
And he lived in the play room
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
With a whip lash in his hand
And every night little girl Sadie would take all her clothes off
And wind up the toy soldier and he'd raise his whip and say to her:
"On your knees little Sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip and bleed for me"
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd lock the door so she could play
Little Sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockwork soldier tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder
"On your knees little Sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip and bleed for me"
One day Sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Til suddenly the little toy soldier's spring, went (boing) (screams)
And he beat her to death! (explosions) (nose blowing)
(Speaking Clock)
"At the first stroke it will be two twenty-one and twenty seconds"
