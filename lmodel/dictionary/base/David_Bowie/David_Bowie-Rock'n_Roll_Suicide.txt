<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Rock'n_Roll_Suicide">
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
Well, the wall to wall is calling, it lingers, but still you forget
Ohh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too young to lose it, but you're too old to choose it
And the clocks waits so patiently on your song
When you walk past a cafe but you can't eat when you've lived too long
Ohh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Now the Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sunlight blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only
Make you care
Oh no, love you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
(Wonderful)
Just gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful
(Wonderful)
I said, gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful
(Wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful
(Wonderful hands)
'Cause you're, gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful
(Wonderful hands)
Gimme your hands, gimme your hands
(Wonderful hands, wonderful hands, wonderful hands)
(Wonderful hands, wonderful hands)
'Cause you're wonderful, gimme your hands
'Cause you're wonderful, baby, hands
(Wonderful hands)
