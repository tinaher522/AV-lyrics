{This is Andy Warhol and it's take one, take one
It's, it's Warhol actually
What did I say?
Whole, it's whole as in wholes
Aa, Andy Warhol
Wah, Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol
Like whole hub
Andy Warhol like what?
He, ha
Are you ready?
Yeah, ha ha ha}
Like to take a cement fix 
Be a standing cinema 
Dress my friends up just for show 
See them as they really are 
Put a peephole in my brain 
Two new Pence to have a go
Like to be a gallery 
Put you all inside my show
Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy walking, Andy tired 
Andy take a little snooze 
Tie him up when he's fast asleep 
Send him on a pleasant cruise 
When he wakes up on the sea 
Sure to think of me and you 
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all
