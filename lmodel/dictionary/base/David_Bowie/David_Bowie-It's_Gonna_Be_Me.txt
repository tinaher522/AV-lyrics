Hey Jack, I better shake it off
Put her out of my head
The thinking of all, just another young girl last night
Oh brother! I left a woman
in that morning day
Been on that trip so many times
Good-God! was really yesterday
I've tried so many, many, many, many, many
many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day,
leaving another girl to
weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name
Hit me! Jack, 'cause I'm
gone! love her way
[Come back, my *brain*] {?
Come back my brain
Feel holy again, I gave her
[I gave her] oww, baby, baby
Gotta give her, oww, baby, baby
that kind of love
can only destroy
I gave her, oww, baby, baby
Gettin' down, if I'm gonna be, the baby wants it
Gonna be me
[It's gonna be me]
There was no rein to check me
when all th-ose little things walked on by
Oh! but I couldn't feel this, stammer out a word,
when that angel stuck in my mind
Oo, oo, oo, oo
Lookin' for love won't hold me back
[No!]
I'm gonna love her way
Come back my brain
Feel holy again
I gave her
Gotta give it, love
Oww, baby, baby
That kind of love
can only destroy
I gave her, oww, baby, baby
Gotta get it now, If I'm
gonna be her baby
It's gonna be me, yeah
Let's play, not play this record
Waitin' for the telephone to ring
Wiped-out and bitter, with a
bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're
pulling in the drive
Umm, no, no, no, no, no, uhh
I see her now
A little tear running down her check
Laugh! Let down
People looking for me
I want to race down her street
and knock hard, hard, hard on the door 'til
Until she breaks down in my arms like a
*Tracy tie*, yell "I feel the pain" {?
I'll be so strong again and again
Come back my brain, yeah
I'm holy again
I'll take ya, oww, babe, baby, baby
We're gonna have, oww, baby, baby,
My kind of love
can only bring you joy
I'm gonna, oww, baby
Yeah, got far
Give you, baby, baby
'Cause it's gonna be me [It's gonna be me]
Umm, hmm, hmm
