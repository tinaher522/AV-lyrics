London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
brought me down
Don't like your new face
that's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
take me away
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy,
and his sellings thorny crown
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away,
but I loved her!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
brought me down
Don't like your new face
that's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty,
and she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
when she finds she has no money
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now,
but I loved her!
Ahhh!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
brought me down
Don't like your new face
that's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Ahh
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
brought me down
Don't like your new face
that's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, eh
