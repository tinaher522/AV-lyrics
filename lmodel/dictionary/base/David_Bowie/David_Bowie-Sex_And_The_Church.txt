<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Sex_And_The_Church">
Though the idea of compassion
Is said to be
The union of Christ
And his bride, the Christian
It's all very puzzling
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church
And the church
All the great mystic religions
Put strong emphasis, on
Redeaming spiritual qualities
Of sex
Of sex
Chrstianity 
Has been pretty modern
About sex
Of sex, of sex, of sex, of sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex, sex
I think there is a union
Between the flesh and the spirit
It's sex and the church
Sex and the church
All religions' mother
Give me you're freedom of spirit
And the joys of the flesh
Of sex, sex
Sex and the church
Give me you're freedom of spirit
And the joys of the flesh
Of sex, sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church
And the church
Sex sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church
And the church
Sex sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex sex
Sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex sex
