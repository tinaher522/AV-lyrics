Peter said to the bird:  "Fly down and circle over the wolf's head. Only take care that he doesn't catch you."
The bird almost touched the wolf's head with his wings while the wolf snapped angrily at him, this side and that.
How that bird teased the wolf! And how the wolf wanted to catch him! But the bird was clever, and the wolf simply couldn't do anything about it.
