<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Moonage_Daydream_(Arnold_Corns_Version)">
Come on strong girl, lay the heavy trick on me
The church of man, love, is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Alright ah
Come on you lovers
Far out
Keep your mouth shut, but listen to the world inside
Keep your head on, but open up your eyes real wide
Keep the change strong, let the things you torn aside
You messing any road to high
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Take it out take it out
Oh 
Oh
Ready
