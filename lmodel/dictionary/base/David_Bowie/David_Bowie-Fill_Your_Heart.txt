<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Fill_Your_Heart">
Fill your heart with love today   
Don't play the game of time 
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind
Only in your mind, ah, forget your mind
And you'll be free, yeah   
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah 
And you can know it all
If you choose 
Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure 
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it free
Free
Oh, happiness is happening
Dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fear's just in your head
Only in your head
Fear is in your head
Only in your head
So forget your head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah, and you can know it all
If you choose 
Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind
And make you free
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah
