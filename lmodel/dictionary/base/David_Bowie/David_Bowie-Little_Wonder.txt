<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Little_Wonder">
Stinking weather fat
Shaky hand
Dopey morning Doc
Grumpy gnomes
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Big screen dolls
Tits and Explosions
Sleepy time
Bashful but nude
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Enter galactic
See me to be you
It's all in the tablets
Sneezy Bhutan
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Mars happy nation
Sit on my karma
Dame meditation
Take me away
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
Little wonder
You little wonder you
Little wonder
You little wonder you
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
Little wonder, you little wonder you
Little wonder, you little wonder you
You little wonder, little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
