<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Queen_Bitch">
I'm up on the eleventh floor 
And I'm watching the cruisers below 
He's down on the street 
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement 
My weekend's at an all time low 
'Cause she's hoping to score 
So I can't see her letting him go 
Walk out of her heart 
Walk out of her mind 
Oh, not her
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh yeah
She's an old-time ambassador of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it, then she can do it
She don't make false claims 
But she's a queen, and such are queens, that your laughter is sucked in their brains 
Now she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
Yes, she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
But it could have been me 
Yes, it could have been me 
Why didn't I say? Why didn't I say?
No, no, no 
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that 
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold, it don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab 'cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all
It could have been me, oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say
No, no, no 
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that
