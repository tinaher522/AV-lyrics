<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Try_Some,_Buy_Some">
Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some
I bought some
Oh, ho
 
After a while
When I had tried them
Denied them
I opened my eyes 
And I saw you
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Woh, ho, ho 
Oh, ho
Woh, ho, ho
Oh, ho
Oh, ho, ho
Oh, ho
Through my life
I've seen gray sky
Met big fry
Seen them die 
To get high
Oh, ho, ho
And when it seemed that 
I would only 
Be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Woh, ho, ho 
Oh, ho
Woh, ho, ho
Oh, ho
Oh, ho, ho, oh
Won't you try some?
Baby, won't you buy some? 
Won't you try some?
Baby, won't you buy some? 
Woh, woh
Woh, ho, oh
Woh, woh
Woh, ho, oh
Woh, woh, woh, oh
Woh, woh, 
Woh, ho, oh
