<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Procession_At_The_Zoo">
But Peter, sitting in the tree, said: "Don't shoot! Birdie and I have already caught the wolf. Now help us take him to the zoo."
Now just imagine, just imagine the triumphant procession. Peter at the head. After him the hunters leading the wolf. And winding up the whole procession grandfather and the cat.
Grandfather shook his head discontentedly. "Well, if Peter hadn't caught the wolf? What's then?"
Above them flew Birdie chirping merrily. "My, what brave fellows we are, Peter and I! Look what we have caught!"
And if one would listen very carefully, he would hear the duck quacking inside the wolf, because the wolf, in his hurry, had swallowed her alive.
