Hey man,
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Ooh
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Oh, she's all right
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooh, oh Suffragette City
Ooh, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, yea
Ah, wham bam thank you ma'am!
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City - Quite alright
My Suffragette City - Too fine
My Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Suffragette!
