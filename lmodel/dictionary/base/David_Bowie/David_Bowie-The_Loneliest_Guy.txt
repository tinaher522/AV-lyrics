<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Loneliest_Guy">
- Album: Reality
- Lyrics and music by David Bowie
Streets turn from walls
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy 
Steam on the floor
Shots by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and old
No Sign No nothing Now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not me
