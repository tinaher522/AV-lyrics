<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Segue-Baby_Grace_(A_Horrid_Cassette)">
Test, testing, testing
This, hmm, Grace is my name and, and I was, hm
It was that phot, a fading photograph of
A patch, a patchwork quilt
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain hatch
And, ah, they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop, popular musics and aftershocks
I've been watching a television of, um, in the homelands
That's the new homelands and, um, and that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid
