All The Young Dudes
Ziggy rapped all night 'bout his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
All that speed child, 
Who'd wanna stay alive
When you're 25?
Lucy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the scars from his face ?
Funky little boat race ?
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey brother you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Oh! You Pretty Things
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
I look out my window and what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
