<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Something_In_The_Air">
Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye
We lay in each other's arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we've lived it out
Something in the air
We smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to say
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Let's take what we can
I know you'll hold your head up high
We've raged for the last time
A place of no return
And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Yea
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo, I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're gonna pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will
There's something in the air
Raged for the last time
But I know you'll hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in our eyes
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
I've danced with you too long
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Danced with you too long
Doo doo
Danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in the air
Doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo doo doo
