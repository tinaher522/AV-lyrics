<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Gospel_According_To_Tony_Day">
The gospel according to Tony Day (x3)
If I find a girl he'll take her away
Rotten Tony
The gospel according to Brendan O'Lear (x3)
If I buy him a scotch he'll buy me a beer
Tight fist, friends
The gospel according to Pat Hewitt (x3)
If it's written on a sweater then I'd better not do it
gotta gotta, your mind, blow it, blow it
The gospel according to Marianne Brent (x3)
she'll be mine if I pay the rent
Good old Marianne, who needs friends, oh
Waste of flippin' time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick, butchers, rotten Harry down the hall
Wouldn't give me tuppence for him
