<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Who_Can_I_Be_Now?">
Everybody's raised in blindness
Everbody know's it's true
Everybody feels that everything is real
Anbody's point of you
Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same
Please help me
Whoooo, can I be nooow you found me
Oooo, can I be held apart, you found me
Nooow can I be, nooow you found me
Nooow can I be real
Can I be real 
(Backing singers: "Sombody real")
If it's all a vast creation
Putting on a face that's new
Someone has to see 
a role for him and me
Someone might as well be you
Up in heaven any angel
writes a special game to play
Oh ho, could we, could we make a start 
to snatch their Angels part 
a major role for everyday
Please help me
Whoooo, can I be nooow you found me
Oooo, can I be held apart, you found me
Nooow can I be nooow you found me
Nooow can I be real(Can I be) 
Whooo, can I be Nooow you found me
Whoooo, can I be held apart you found me
Nooow can I be, nooow you found me
Noooow can I, can I be real
Can I be
Can I be 
You found me
Who can I be real
Ye ye yeah
Can I be 
You found Love
Can I be real
Can, can I
