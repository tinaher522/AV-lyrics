<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Right">
CHORUS 1
Taking it all the right way
Keeping it in the back
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back
Never need, no
Never no turning back
CHORUS 2
Flying just a sweet place
Coming inside and safe
Flying just a sweet place
Never been known to fail
Never been, no
Never been known to fail
Wishing you,
wishing that sometimes (sometimes)
Doing it, doing it right, 'til (doing it) one time (one time)
Gets you when you're down
(nobody, nobody, do it again, get off)
Ahhh, sometimes, doing
Wishing sometimes (give it back) 
Up there, up there (giving it)
Oh, my darling
(No) Ah, my darling, (giving it) ah (up there) why?
Gimme, gimme, up there, (yeah) gimme, doing
Taking with me (sometimes)
Loving it, doing it (right) 'til (take it) one time
Gimme (doing it) 
Giving it (giving it back)
CHORUS 1 (3 times)
CHORUS 2
CHORUS 1
(repeat ad-lib)
Never no turning back
Never, never, never
