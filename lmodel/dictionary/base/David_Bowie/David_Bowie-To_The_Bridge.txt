<song artist="David_Bowie" title="To_The_Bridge">
I sell the morning paper, sir, my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
You can hear me yelling, "Morning Star", as I run along the street
I've got no hat upon my head, no shoes upon my feet
I sell the morning paper, sir, my name is Jimmy brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
Never mind, sir, how I look, don't look at me and frown
I sell the morning paper, sir, my name is Jimmy Brown
I'm awful cold and hungry, sir, my clothes are mighty thin
I wander 'bout from place to place, my daily bread to win
I sell the morning paper, sir, my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
My father was a drunkard, sir, I've heard my mother say
And I am helping my mother, sir, as I journey on my way
My mother always tells me, sir, I've nothing in the world to do
I'll get a place in Heaven, sir, selling the gospel news
I sell the morning paper, sir, my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
