hearts filthy lesson (x3)
there's always a diamond friendly
sitting in the laugh's hotel
the hearts filthy lesson
with her hundred miles to hell
oh ramona
if there was only something between us
if there was only something between us (only something)
other than our clothes
something in our sky
something in our sky
something in our blood
something in our sky
paddy?
paddy?
who's been wearing miranda's clothes?
it's the hearts filthy lesson
hearts filthy lesson
hearts filthy lesson
falls upon deaf ears
(hearts filthy lesson)
it's the hearts filthy lesson
hearts filthy lesson
hearts filthy lesson
falls upon deaf ears
falls upon deaf years
oh ramona
if there was only some kind of future
oh ramona
if there was only some kind of future
and these cerulean skies
something in our skies
something in our skies
something in our blood
something in our sky
paddy?
paddy?
(uhh)
paddy will you carry me
i think i've lost my way
(hearts filthy lesson
hearts filthy lesson)
i'm already five years older
i'm already in my grave
i'm already
i'm already
i'm already
will you carry me?
oh paddy i think i've lost my way
paddy?
what a fantastic death abyss
paddy?
what a fantastic death abyss
(Hearts filthy lesson)
it's the Hearts Filthy Lesson
tell the others
(Hearts filthy lesson)
it's the Hearts Filthy Lesson
what a fantastic death abyss
tell the others
(Hearts filthy lesson)
it's the Hearts Filthy Lesson
paddy, what a fantasic death abyss
(Hearts filthy lesson)
it's the Hearts Filthy Lesson
tell the others
