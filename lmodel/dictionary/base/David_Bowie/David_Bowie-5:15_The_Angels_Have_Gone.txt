5:15
I'm changing trains - this little town - let me down
This foreign rain brings me down
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone
No ticket
I'm jumping tracks
I'm changing time
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you
5:15
All of my life, Angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings
Swings turn the eyes
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you
Cold station all of my life
Forever I fear
