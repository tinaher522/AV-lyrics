<song artist="David_Bowie" title="How_Lucky_You_Are">
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind in life
Shadows stalking, ever grasping sinking for a need
It was love it was the fix of wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and you turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game
Cry, Mr Pathetic
I'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
You the halo_system
Take a look at how lucky we are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more
Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
La La La La La
