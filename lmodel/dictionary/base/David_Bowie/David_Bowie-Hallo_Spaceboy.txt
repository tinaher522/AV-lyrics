<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Hallo_Spaceboy">
Spaceboy, you're sleepy now 
Your silhouette is so stationary 
You're released but your custody calls 
And I wanna be free 
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days 
But moondust will cover you 
Cover you 
This chaos is killing me 
So bye bye, love 
Yeah, bye bye, love 
Bye bye, love 
Yeah, bye bye, love 
This chaos is killing me 
Hallo spaceboy, you're sleepy now 
Your silhouette is so stationary 
You're released but your custody calls 
And I wanna be free 
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days 
But moondust will cover you 
Cover you
And the chaos is killing me 
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love 
So, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me 
This chaos is killing me 
Yeah, bye bye, love 
Bye bye, love 
Good time, love 
Be sweet sweet dove 
Bye bye, spaceboy 
Bye bye, love 
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
