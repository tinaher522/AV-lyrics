<song artist="David_Bowie" title="'Tis_A_Pity_She_Was_A_Whore">
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol, that was patrol
This is the war
Black struck the kiss, she kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
'Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse with rattling speed
That was patrol, this is the war
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis a pity she was a whore
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis my fate, I suppose
That was patrol, that was patrol
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis a pity she was cold
Wooh
Wooh
