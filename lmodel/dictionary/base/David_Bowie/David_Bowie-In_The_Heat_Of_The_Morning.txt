<song artist="David_Bowie" title="In_The_Heat_Of_The_Morning">
The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
