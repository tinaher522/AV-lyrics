<song artist="David_Bowie" title="20th_Century_Boy">
Friends say it's fine 
Friends say it's good 
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood 
I walk like a rat
Crawl like a cat
Sting like a bee 
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see 
You were meant for me 
Yeah, I'm your toy 
Your 20th Century boy 
Friends say it's fine 
Friends say it's good 
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Fly like a plane 
Drive like a car 
Ball like a hound 
Babe I'm gonna be your man 
And it's plain to see 
You were meant for me 
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy
20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy (x4)
Friends say it's fine 
Friends say it's good 
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood 
I walk like a rat
Crawl like a cat
Sting like a bee 
Babe I'm gonna be your man 
And it's plain to see 
You were meant for me 
Yeah I'm your toy 
Your 20th Century boy
20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy (x4)
