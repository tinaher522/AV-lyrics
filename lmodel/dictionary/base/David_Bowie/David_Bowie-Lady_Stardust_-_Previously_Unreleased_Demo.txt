<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Lady_Stardust_-_Previously_Unreleased_Demo">
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang her songs of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
The femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
And I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
And Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Oh how I lied when they asked if I knew his name
For he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite paradise
And he sang all night long
