<song artist="David_Bowie" title="A_Better_Future">
Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain, all this sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
Give my children sunny smiles
Give them warm and cloudless skies
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
I might just stop loving you, loving you
When you talk
We talk too
When you walk
We walk too
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down here below
Nothing is moving
I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
