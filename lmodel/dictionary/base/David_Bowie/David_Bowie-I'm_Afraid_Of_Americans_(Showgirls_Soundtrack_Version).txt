Johnny's in America
Johnny looks up at the stars
Johnny combs his hair
And Johnny wants pussy and cars
Johnny's in America
Johnny's in America
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
Johnny's in America
Johnny wants a brain
Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman
Johnny wants to think of a joke
Johnny's in America
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
Johnny's in America
Johnny's in America
Johnny's in America
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
Johnny's an American
Johnny's an American
Johnny's an American
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of the animals
I'm afraid of their world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
Yeah. I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of their words
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans 
God is an american (repeat ad infinium)
