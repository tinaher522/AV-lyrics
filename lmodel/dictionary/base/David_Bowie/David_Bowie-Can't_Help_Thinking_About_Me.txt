<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Can't_Help_Thinking_About_Me">
Question time
That says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says
That she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags
Leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Remember when
We used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night
Terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends always be found
And I can't
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Now I leave them all
In the Never-Never Land
The station seems so cold
The ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name,
"Hi Dave.
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again."
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long, long way to go
I hope I make it on my own
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
