<song artist="David_Bowie" title="New_Killer_Star">
See the great white scar
Over Battery park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar 
Oh, my nuclear baby 
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance 
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you 
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now 
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go 
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color 
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on dateline
Let's face the music and dance 
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you 
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now 
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
Ooo oo oooo
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
