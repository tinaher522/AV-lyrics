Born in a UFO
(She was) born in a UFO
I come to the glade and watch the saucer land
She glided through the mist in an a-line skirt
Booted her shoes like hooves in the dirt
Her clutch bag reflected the sun and steel
The 50's movie, so many squealed
There’s no direction home she pleads
She cornered me against the trees
I was home I thought, my life could start
She was (not like the other girls)
(I was) born under a stone
(We were) born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
My friends sit around at the end of town
With their heads in their hands in the cool twilight air
I can see by their eyes that they’re bitching sore
I’d rather be dead than fool around here anymore
She was all courage, geometric face
Electric skin, plastic and lace
Silver hair, trapezoid flanks
I was so in love with her lavender vest
She was (not like the other girls)
(I was) born under a stone
(We were) born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Like outer space
She was (not like the other girls)
(I was) born under a stone
(We were) born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
(She was) born in a UFO
