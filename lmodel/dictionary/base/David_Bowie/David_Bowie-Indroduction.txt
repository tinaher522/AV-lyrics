<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Indroduction">
This is the story of Peter and the wolf.
Each character in the tale is going to be represented by a different instrument of the orchestra. For instance, the bird will be played by the flute. (Like this.) Here's the duck, played by the oboe.
The cat by the clarinet.
The bassoon will represent grandfather.
The wolf by the French horns.
And Peter by the strings.
The blast of the hunters' shotguns played by the kettle drums.
Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin.
