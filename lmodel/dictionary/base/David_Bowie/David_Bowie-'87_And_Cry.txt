<song artist="David_Bowie" title="'87_And_Cry">
It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind no
And only you
Rocket on thru the sky
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
Yeah it couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
When the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the big guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream no
And only you
Race on to wonder where
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy
Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murder on the heels of love
Just a ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
Well it couldn't be done with dogs
Well it couldn't be once without us
87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry cry cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry cry cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry cry cry cry cry
'87 and cry cry cry cry cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
Hey
Hey
'87 and cry
