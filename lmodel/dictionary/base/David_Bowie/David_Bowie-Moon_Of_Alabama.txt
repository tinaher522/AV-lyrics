<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Moon_Of_Alabama">
Oh show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh don't ask why
No don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Or if we don't find the next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
I must have whiskey
Oh you know why
Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
I must have whiskey
Oh you know why
Oh show us the way to the next little dollar
Oh don't ask why
No don't ask why
For we must find the next little dollar
Or if we don't find the next little dollar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
I must have dollar
Oh you know why
Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
I must have dollar
Oh you know why
Oh show us the way to the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
No don't ask why
For we must find the next little girl
Or if we don't find the next little girl
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
I must have little girl
Oh you know why
Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say auf Wiedersehen
We've lost our good old mama
I must have little girl
Oh you know why
You know why
You know why
You know why
