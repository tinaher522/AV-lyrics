<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Never_Get_Old">
Better take care
I think I better go, better get  a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breath so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
Looks me in the eye, says he's got his mind on a countdown(3,2,1)
Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low cause it's all over now
And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light and living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking to the future, solid as a rock
Because of you
Again and again
Wanna be here, then I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me
Forever
Putting on my gloves
And I bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul
But I don't need a thing
Just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get...
I'm never ever gonna get...
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get...
And I'm never ever gonna get...
I'm never ever gonna get old
