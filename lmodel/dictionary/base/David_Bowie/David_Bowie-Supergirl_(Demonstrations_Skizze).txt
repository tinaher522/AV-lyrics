<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Supergirl_(Demonstrations_Skizze)">
Supergirl Maybe I can't kill you off after all
Supergirl I don't want to kill you off after all
Open hands catch the light you're after
Breathe again fill the moon with laughter
Kill the man in his house of infidels
Supergirl so unflagging in your glow after all
Supergirl you're the strongest girl I know after all
Open hands catch the light you're after
Breathe again fill the moon with laughter
Kill the man in his house of infidels
Destined thousand names have burned tonight
Come watch them from the shore and there' still time
For you to run away and not come back no more
Just don't regret a thing
Cause I don't regret a thing
Open hands catch the light you're after
Breathe again fill the moon with laughter
Kill the man in his house of infidels
