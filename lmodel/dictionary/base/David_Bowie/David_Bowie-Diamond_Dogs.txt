<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Diamond_Dogs">
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooooooooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh
