<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Last_Thing_You_Should_Do">
What have you been doing to yourself
What have you been doing to yourself
What have you been doing to yourself
It's the last thing you should do-oh-oh-oh-oh
Nobody laughs any more
Nobody laughs any more
Nobody laughs any more
It's the worst thing you can do-oh-oh-oh-oh
Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah!
Yeah!
What have you been doing to yourself
What have you been doing to yourself
What have you been doing to yourself
It's the last thing you should do-oh-oh-oh-oh
Nobody laughs any more
Nobody laughs any more
Nobody laughs any more
It's the worst thing you can do-oh-oh-oh-oh
Save the last dance with me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
