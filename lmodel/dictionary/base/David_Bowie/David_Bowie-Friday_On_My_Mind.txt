<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Friday_On_My_Mind">
Monday morning feels so bad (Friday's gone)
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better (te te te te te te ter) 
Even my old man looks good (bah-oom)
Wednesday just don't go (bah-oom)
Thursday goes too slow (bah-oom)
I've got Friday on my mind
(See my baby) Gonna have fun in the city (feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw) Be with my girl she's so pretty (all I want to do)
(I'll go crazy) She looks fine tonight (zoom zoom zoom zoom)
(zoom zoom zoom) She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my brain
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind
Do the five day drag once more (Monday blues)
There was nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich man (poor man, beggar man, thief)
Hey, I'll change that scene one day (bah-oom)
Today I might be mad (bah-oom) 
Tomorrow I'll be glad (bah-oom)
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind
(See my baby) Gonna have fun in the city (feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw) Be with my girl she's so pretty (all I want to do)
(I'll go crazy) She looks fine tonight (zoom zoom zoom zoom)
(zoom zoom zoom) She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight)  I spend my bread
(Tonight)  I lose my head
(Tonight)  I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind
(See my baby soon) Gonna have fun in the city (feel like fucking you) 
(Do my baby) Be with my girl, she's so pretty (all I want to do)
(oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh) Gonna have fun-a, gonna have fun in the city (zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom)
(oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh) Be with my girl-a, be with my girl she's so pretty
(zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom)
(See my baby soon) Gonna have fun-a,gonna have fun in the city (feel like fucking you).... 
(Do my baby) Be with my girl-a, be with my girl she's so pretty hey hey (all I want to do)(zoom zoom zoom zoom) Gonna have fun-a , gonna have fun in the city (zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom) (ooh ooh ooh oooh) (zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom)
