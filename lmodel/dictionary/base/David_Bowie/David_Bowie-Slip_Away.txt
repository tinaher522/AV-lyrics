<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Slip_Away">
Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away
Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world in war torn
How I wonder where you are
Ohhh-oo
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Oo-o
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world inwar torn
How I wonder where you are
Ohhh-oo
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
