<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Let's_Dance">
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
If you should fall
Into my arms
Tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song we're playing
Let's sway
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
Let's dance
Let's
Let's
Let's
Let's sway
Let's
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
