<song artist="David_Bowie" title="See_Emily_Play">
Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
