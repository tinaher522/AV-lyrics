<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Hang_On_To_Yourself_(Arnold_Corns_Version)">
Thought we had a good thing going, and you know and Mama had a thing on
My baby got out last monday and me I'm on a radio show
So come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Come on, Come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
My Father had a good thing going, and you know Mother had a thing on the street
My baby got out last monday and me I'm on a radio show
So come on, so come on, we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Well come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Come on, come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Well come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Ah, Alright, Alright, Come on, He, Come on
He, Come on, He, Come on, He, Come on, He
Come on, He, Come on, He, Come on, He,
Come on, He, Come on, He, Come on, He,
Come on, He, Come on, He, Come on, He,
Come on, Come on, Come on, He, Come on,
He, Come on, He, Come on, Come on, Come
on
