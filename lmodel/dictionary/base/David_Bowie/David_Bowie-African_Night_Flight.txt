<song artist="David_Bowie" title="African_Night_Flight">
African nightmare, one-time Mormon
More men fall in hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman, I went too far
Bent on a windfall, rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey ho, he wished me well
Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through
One of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through
One of these days

Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff, skimming over rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming, dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left unnamed
Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Over the bushland, over the trees
Wise like orangutan, that was me
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through
One of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through
One of these days
