<song artist="David_Bowie" title="★">
In the villa of Ormen
In the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
In the centre of it all
In the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution
On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile
At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes
In the villa of Ørmen
In the villa of Ørmen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre, then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place and bravely cried
"I'm a black star. I'm a black star."
How many times does an angel fall
How many people lie instead of talking tall
He trod on sacred ground, he cried aloud into the crowd:
"I'm a black star. I'm a black star. I'm not a gangster."
I can't answer why (I'm a black star)
Just go with me (I'm not a film star)
I'mma take you home (I'm a black star)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a pop star)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a black star)
You're the flash in the pan (I'm not a Marvel star)
I'm the great I am (I'm a black star)
I'm a black star, I'm way up on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams and diamonds in my eyes
I'm a black star, I'm a black star
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place and bravely cried
"I'm a black star. I'm a star star. I'm a black star."
I can't answer why (I'm not a gangster)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flam star)
We were born upside down (I'm a star star)
Born the wrong way around (I'm not a white star, I'm a black star)
I'm not a gangster, I'm a black star, I'm a black star
I'm not a porn star, I'm not a wandering star
I'm a black star, I'm a black star
In the villa of Ørmen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes
