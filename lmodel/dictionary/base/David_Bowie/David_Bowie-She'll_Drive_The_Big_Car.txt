- Album: Reality
- Lyrics and music by David Bowie
She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course he'll never show 
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home, through the snow
North-bound on river-side
She slipped beneath the sheets
Her husband's quiet devoted wife
But strange, and sad, and nervous
By the dawn's early light
And love lies like a dead clown
On a shabby yellow lawn
Up on Riverside
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep her mind on Jessica
South along the Hudson 
She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad, soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there) 
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there) 
She'll drive the big car
Tuck herself to sleep
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(I'll bring you there) 
Way back when millenium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her the dream life
He took her back to street life
Away from wild and water
With his cormorants and leaves
Up on Riverside
Uh, she'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of love and grand
South along the Hudson 
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there) 
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there) 
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there) 
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
(I'll bring you there)
She'll keep her mind on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
