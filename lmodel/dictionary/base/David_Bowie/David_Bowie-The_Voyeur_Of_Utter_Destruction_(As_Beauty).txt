<song artist="David_Bowie" title="The_Voyeur_Of_Utter_Destruction_(As_Beauty)">
Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again
I shake
And stare the sun
'Till my eyes burn
I shake
At the mothers
Brutal vermin
I shake
And stare
At the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober philistine
Turn and turn again
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
The screw
Is a tightening atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The voyeur
Of utter destruction
As beauty
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
I shake
I shake
Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day
Call it a day
Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
Call it a day
