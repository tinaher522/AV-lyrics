<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Too_Dizzy">
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm not trying to lose control
But you're just pushin' pushin' pushin'for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking looking looking for a break
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away hey
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
I said
Too Dizzy-You can't have a lover
I'm too Dizzy-It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
I'm a too Dizzy-you can't have no lover
You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break
There's too much talking for a night drive
And too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking looking looking for a break
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
I said
I'm too Dizzy-You can't have a lover
I'm too Dizzy-It's me and no other
And I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
I said too Dizzy-you can't have no lover
I said Too Dizzy
Don't come any harder
I said I'm Too Dizzy
Don't come any closer
I said I'm Too Dizzy
I said too Dizzy
Too Dizzy
Too Dizzy
Too Dizzy you can't have no lover
Too Dizzy
Too Dizzy
I'm Too Dizzy
