<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Rupert_The_Riley">
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
I'm the greatest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild, if you sit by my side
See how far we travel take hold the wheel
I'll drive you to hell
If you take hold the wheel
Wo-wo-wo-woo, yea-yea-yea-yeah
Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
I guess I've gotÂ ?? Riley of mine
She's shaky on her legs, that Riley of mine
I'm the greatest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild, if you sit by my side
Wo-wo-wo-woo, yea-yea-yea-yeah
Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
