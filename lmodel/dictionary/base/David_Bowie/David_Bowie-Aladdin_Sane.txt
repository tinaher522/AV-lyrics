<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Aladdin_Sane">
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
(See the lights all shining bright on Broadway)
