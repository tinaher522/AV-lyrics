<song artist="David_Bowie" title="I_Can't_Give_Everything_Away">
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
