<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Silly_Boy_Blue">
Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la, la la 
La la la, la la 
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Silly Boy Blue 
Silly Boy Blue
