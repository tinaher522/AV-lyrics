<song artist="David_Bowie" title="1984-Dodo">
Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, the tracks are on tv
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll break your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but lover you won't care
You'll be shooting up this huge world, like tomorrow's wasn't there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
(come see, come see, remember me? )
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we've grown
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for more)
Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They cooly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time
He's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me
He's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me
She doesn't recall her blessed childhood out of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perk's are due
Another memo to screw
She's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me
She's a do do, no no didn't hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child without them slotting in your file a photograph
Will you sleep in fear tonight wake to find the scorching light of neighbour jim
Come to, turn you in
But the do do, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do do, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do do, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do do, no no, didn't hear from me
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(mor-or-or-or-ore)
198 4
1984
1984 (mor-or-or-or-ore)
1984
1984 (mor-or-or-or-ore)
1984
1984 (mor-or-or-or-ore)
