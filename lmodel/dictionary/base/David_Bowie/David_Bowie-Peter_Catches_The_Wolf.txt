<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Peter_Catches_The_Wolf">
Meanwhile, Peter made a lasso and carefully letting it down and down and down, caught the wolf by the tail and pulled with all his might.
Feeling himself caught, the wolf began to jump wildly trying to get loose.
But Peter tied the other end of rope to the tree, and the wolf's jumping only made the rope round his tail tighter.
