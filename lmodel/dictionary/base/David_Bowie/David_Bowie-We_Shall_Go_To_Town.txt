<song artist="David_Bowie" title="We_Shall_Go_To_Town">
No more delight or croning around
Whisper the word hold my hand
Nowhere forget I shall refuse you
Never forget who you've been
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And we'll read betwen the riches
And we'll dream if we don't go down
Follow the paths stay on the wrong side
Only when you is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things just like you serve you
Only fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And you will wear you're best shoes
And we'll dance if we don't go down
And we'll dance if we don't go down
