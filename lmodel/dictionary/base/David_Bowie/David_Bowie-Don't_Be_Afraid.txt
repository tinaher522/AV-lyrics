<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Don't_Be_Afraid">
Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Oh darling
Don't be afraid
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to ray what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh oh oh darling
Count me lucky I don't follow you
Don't be afraid of me feeling so blue
Oh darling
Lucky forever
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to ray what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh oh oh darling

Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Oh darling
Don't be afraid
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to ray what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh oh oh darling
Oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
Oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
Oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
Oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
