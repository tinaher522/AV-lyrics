Spoken
Old Touchschriek was the main nameserver 
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer 
But he didn't know from shit 
About challenge response systems 
Now Ramona A. Stone, we know was selling interest drugs 
She got males all hung up on her mind filters 
She was if you don't mine me saying so an update demon 
Now Leon 
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight 
He jumps up on the stage 
With a criss criss machete 
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything 
I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself 
Was this a suspect? 
I say to myself 
Woa! "Quelle courage!" 
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself 
Let me take you back to when it all began
