<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Up_The_Hill_Backwards">
The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
Yea, yea, yea - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright
While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
More idols than realities
I'm OK, you're so-so
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
Yea, yea, yea - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo
