Getting my facts from a Benetton ad
Lookin' through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an LA. fire
(Black tie, white noise)
I've got a face, not just my race
Bang, bang, I've got you babe
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
Sun comes up and the man goes down
Woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
(Black tie, white noise)
Then we jump through hoops
We're divisible now, just disappear
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing 'We shall overcome'
Whoa, what's going on?
(There'll be some blood no doubt about it)
But we'll come through don't doubt it
(I look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you)
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me, you won't kill me, no
But I look into your eyes and I wonder sometimes
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
Oh Lord.just let him see me
Lord, Lord yeah, let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together
Reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking we are the world
Whoa, what's going on?
(There'll be some blood no doubt about it)
We should come through don't doubt it
(I looked into your eyes and I know I won't kill you)
And I turn my back for I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me, yeah, you won't kill me, no
But I wonder why, yes, I wonder why sometimes
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
(Black tie, white noise)
Fascist cries both black and white
Who's got the blood, who's got the gun
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
(Ooh, yeah)
Cranking out
(To the [Incomprehensible])
Cranking out
(Ooh yeah)
Cranking out the white noise
(Black tie, white noise)
(We be yeah)
Cranking out
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Cranking out
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
(Just a fool)
Cranking out
(Just a fool)
Cranking out
(Just a fool)
Cranking out the white noise
(Black tie, white noise)
(Just a fool)
Cranking out
(Just a fool)
Cranking out
(Just a fool)
