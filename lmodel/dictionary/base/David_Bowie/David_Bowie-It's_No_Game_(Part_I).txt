<song artist="David_Bowie" title="It's_No_Game_(Part_I)">
Shirueto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru
Mo tengoku no giu no kaidan wa nai
Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game
Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote iru ka wakara nai
Doko ni kyokun wa aruka
Hitobito wa yabi oorareteiru
Konna dokusaishani igashima rareru nowa kanashi
I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game
Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
They throw the rock against the road
And it breaks into peices
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers
Nammino kiroku eiga
Hioteki o se ni shita koibi to tach
Michi ni ishi o nage reba
Konago na mi kudake
Kino ni hutao sureba
Kyohu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru
So where's the moral when people have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists - it's so degrading
And it's no game
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
