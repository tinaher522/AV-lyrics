<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Yassassin_(Turkish_For:_Long_Live)">
Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - but such a life I've never known
We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away
Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - but such a life I've never known
Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us
If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away
Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - but such a life I've never known
