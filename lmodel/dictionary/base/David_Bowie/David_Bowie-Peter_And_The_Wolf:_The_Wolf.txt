<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Peter_And_The_Wolf:_The_Wolf">
No sooner had Peter gone
Than a big gray wolf came out of the forest
In a twinkling
The cat climbed up into the tree
The duck quacked and in her excitement
Jumped out of the pond
But no matter how hard the duck tried to run
She couldn't escape the wolf
He was getting nearer, nearer
Catching up with her
