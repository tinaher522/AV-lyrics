<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Fantastic_Voyage">
In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody is perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
to shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?
And the wrong words make you listen
in this criminal world
Remember it's true, a loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
But any sudden movement, and I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?
