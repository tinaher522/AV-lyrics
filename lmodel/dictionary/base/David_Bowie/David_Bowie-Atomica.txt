<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Atomica">
I'm just a rock star stabbing away
I'll take the - I'll take the leave for another day
A modern scholar
Just let me know if I sing too much
When you're head over heals and the magic is there but
Impossible
Possible
Impossible
And when the police take me away
Possible
Impossible
It wasn't you it was mother's day
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get atomica
Babe
Protect you from the voices
Protect from the visions
Protect you from the silence for another day
These modern people
They sure know how to live
When you're head over heels and the magic is gone it's
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Then we should swim in that covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed in purple tulle
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get atomica
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
Babe
I'm just a pop star chopping away
I'll take the - I leave the sins for another day
A little puny
Then just let me know if I talk too much
When you're head over heels and the magic is there but
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Then we should swim in that covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed in purple tulle
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get atomica
Babe
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get atomica
Babe
