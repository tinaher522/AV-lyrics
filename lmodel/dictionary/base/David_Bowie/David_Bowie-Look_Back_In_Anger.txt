<song artist="David_Bowie" title="Look_Back_In_Anger">
"You know who I am," he said.
The speaker was an angel:
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings,
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger,
Driven by the night,
till you come."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
See it in my eyes
till you come."
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Driven by the night,
till you come"
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
feel it in my voice,
till you come."
