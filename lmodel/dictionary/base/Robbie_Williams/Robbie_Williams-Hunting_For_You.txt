<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Hunting_For_You">
I walk around
these empty streets
They say there's
nothing left for me
I say there's no one here for you
Down in the land,
the land of the blind
The one eyed king,
he stole my mind
And I let him
Everything I like's
illegal, seductive
Addictive, immoral,
corrosive, destructive
But I've got kind words
in my heart
It's a passion
Your fashions, in fashion
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Oooohooooo
(Repeat)
The stone is set, the dye is cast
I am the wreckage of my past
And I am not afraid to ask
I sail away my sanity
Just to find some company
Now darlin'
Everything I like's
illegal, seductive
Addictive, immoral,
corrosive, destructive
Your addiction to danger
Makes me no stranger
It's fashion, oh fashion
Oooohooooo
Tonight I'm hunting for you
(Repeat)
I'll be good,
but I won't be cheap
There is no limit here for me
And I'll take everything I need
I mean everything, everything
You can waste away in fashion
When you chase
the daylight home
You could waste away in fashion
When you chase
the daylight home
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Oooohooooo
(Repeat)
Tonight I'm hunting for
Oooohooooo
(You could waste
away in fashion)
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Oooohooooo
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Oooohooooo
(When you chase
the daylight home)
Tonight I'm hunting for you
Oooohooooo
Tonight I'm hunting for you
