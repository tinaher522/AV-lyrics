<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Be_A_Boy">
When you're young
You hope to be
Menacing, in vanity
Six feet tall
Maybe more
Bigger now, than before
They said it was leaving me
The magic was leaving me
I don't think so
I don't think so
They said it was leaving
They said it with joy
Now I can make this last forever
And be a boy
And be a boy
When you're young
You hope to see
Them carve your name
Into the street
And bounce your words
Of satellites
That keep the wasted up tonight
They said it was leaving me
The magic was leaving me
I don't think so
I don't think so
They said it was leaving
They said it with joy
Now I can make this last forever
And be a boy
And be a boy
There's safety in a jungle
If you treat it like a toy
Make sure you talk to strangers
And be a boy
And be a boy
And be a boy
They said it was leaving me
The magic was leaving me
I don't think so
I don't think so
All the boys
that could have been someone
Your time did come
but now it's gone
It takes a big man
to be someone
All the boys
that could have been someone
Your time did come
but now it's gone
Your time did come
but now it's gone
It takes a big man
to be someone
I'm half your age
and lived twice your life
And I own the streets
you walk tonight
The time did come
but it's long gone
It takes a big man
to be someone
I'm half your age
and lived twice your life
And I don't sleep alone at night
The time did come
but it's long gone
It takes a big man
to be someone
