<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Wedding_Bells">
Just like the night before Pompeii blows
Nobody really knows where my Rose Marie goes
My friends all think I'm mad and
she makes my dad sad
And he married my mother so
I'll be imagining
Wedding bells
Fairy tales
Carousels
I'm just imagining open doors
Overtures for son-in-laws
And if you want this dream to start then just
open up your broken heart, start imagining
Wedding bells
Fairy tales
And me
She went out Friday
Came in Monday night
She must have left the keys in
somebody else's car
And oh no one completes me more than she
and until she gets home I'll be
I'll be imagining
Wedding bells
Fairy tales
Carousels
I'll be imagining open doors
Overtures for son-in-laws
And if you want this dream to start then just
open up your broken heart, start imagining
Wedding bells
Fairy tales
And me
Oh the comfort of being with the one you
desire for life
Oh the comfort of knowing one day she
will be my bride
And oh no one completes me, more than she
And now 'til she gets home I'll be
I'll be imagining
Wedding bells
Fairy tales
Carousels
I'll be imagining open doors
Overtures for son-in-laws
And if you want this dream to start then just
open up your broken heart, start imagining
Wedding bells
Fairy tales
And me
