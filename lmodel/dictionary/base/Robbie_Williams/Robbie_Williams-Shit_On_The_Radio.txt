<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Shit_On_The_Radio">
Twisted little hurricane
I am a believer
If I take you home again
I will never leave you
Cos this ain't my first rodeo
We can make a video
Pumping on your stereo
To the shit that's on the radio
To the shit that's on the radio
To the shit that's on the radio
Shit that's on the radio
To the shit that's on the radio
Shit that's on the radio
She was so saintly
Sexy little mover
And I've been up all night
So I don't wanna lose her
Cos this ain't my first rodeo
We can make a video
Pumping on your stereo
To the shit that's on the radio
To the shit that's on the radio
To the shit that's on the radio
Shit that's on the radio
To the shit that's on the radio
Shit that's on the radio
Searching for the girl
Searching for the girl
That made a pretty headline
She was such a pretty girl
Such a pretty girl
That made a pretty headline
I know that you know
When we get together
Love you like a hurricane
I know that you know
When we get together
Love you like a hurricane
To the shit that's on the radio
Shit that's on the radio
To the shit that's on the radio
Shit that's on the radio
I know that you know
(shit that's on the radio)
When we get together
(shit that's on the radio)
Love you like a hurricane
(shit that's on the radio)
I know that you know
(shit that's on the radio)
When we get together
(shit that's on the radio)
Love you like a hurricane
