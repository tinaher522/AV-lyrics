<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Into_The_Silence">
When karma reaches you
I want to be there
just in case it needs help
You made me be
so cruel to myself
The love of power
or the power of love
You need help
When karma reaches you
I want to be there
to catch that fall
Get down beside you
and watch you crawl
How does it feel to be alone
Down there
When you fall apart again
It won't break my heart
If I told you my secrets
You'd never look at me
the same way
Well I guess you're right
Some things I can't change
When karma reaches you
I want to be there
just in case it needs help
I won't fall
Apart again
I don't test my heart
Is there any wonder
With this sadness inside us
Was it sent for the hunger
Was it meant to divide us
Into the silence
(Repeat)
When karma reaches you
I want to be there
to catch that fall
Get down beside you
and watch you crawl
How does it feel to be alone
Down there
Don't fall
Apart again
Don't test my heart
Is there any wonder
With the sadness inside her
Was it sent for the hunger
Was it meant to divide us
Into the silence
(Repeat)
