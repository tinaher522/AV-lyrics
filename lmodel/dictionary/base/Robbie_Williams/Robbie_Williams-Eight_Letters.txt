<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Eight_Letters">
We became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned,
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives will have meaning eventually
We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another and
What was the question and why was the lesson so deafening.
This all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there
And when I went away what I forgot to say was
All I had to say
eight letter three words one meaning
And outside forces didn't make it easy so I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self preservation was no explanation for anything
Oh but the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend I've just started to understand my friend all of that distance cause I fell in love with the enemy
This all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there
And when I went away what I forgot to say was all I had to say
eight letter three words one meaning
eight letter three words one meaning
At last we meet on no man's land just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land at last
And when I went away what I forgot to say was all I had to say
eight letter three words one meaning
eight letter three words one meaning
One meaning, just one meaning, one meaning.
