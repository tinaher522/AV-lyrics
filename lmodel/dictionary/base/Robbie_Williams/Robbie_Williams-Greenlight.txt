<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Greenlight">
A kind of fire seldom seen
Stepping into your machine
Hoping I can turn it on
She dances all night and sleeps all day
Her room's a mess, her dad's away
She puts her heroes on the wall
With her green light
Green light
To hold a faded flower to my chest
Green light, green light
'Cause only faded flowers are the best
She said the things you will expect
From magazines, her intellect
These are words I will forget
She likes the boys that sing the songs
Something wicked this way comes
I know I can sing along
Just give me the green light
Green light
To hold a faded flower to my chest
Green light, green light
'Cause underrated flowers are the best
I was barely out of school
She knew someone who I was with
I've never seen anything like her before
She is trouble
Exquisite trouble
I'm out of your league son
She seemed to say
And for a little while
She was
Leave the light on
Leave the light on
Ohh ohh oh oh, ohh ohh oh oh
Leave the light on
Just leave the light on
Ohh ohh oh oh, ohh ohh oh oh
Ohh ohh oh
She gave me the green light
Green light
To hold the faded flower to my chest
She gave me the green light
Green light
Those overrated flowers are the best
'Cause only faded flowers are the best
