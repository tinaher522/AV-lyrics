Visitors, engineering
All we need is a clearing
We dont know what to feed em
Or even if were really needin

Highway to the stars tonight
Leave the bad news at home
Highway to the stars tonight
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below 

Sirius, can you hear me?
I know youre there, will you steer me?
51, I ll be waiting
If you dont mind,
I ll bring my mate in

Highway to the stars tonight
Leave the bad news at home
Highway to the stars tonight
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below 

In the Gentlemens Club
(In the Gentlemens Club)
They are passing round their radar (??) / radio (??) / red era (??)
(They are passing round their radar)
Its such a hollow balloon
(Its such a hollow balloon)
Telling people what to do
(What to do)
They are watching you
(They are watching you)

Entities all around me
I cant explain how they found me
Were occupied, but we dont know it
And theres no way to expose it

Highway to the stars tonight
Leave the bad news at home
Highway to the stars tonight
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below 

Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below 

Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below (Look out below)
Look out below 

(Look out below - look out below)
(Look out below - look out below)
(Look out below)

And even going home
Dont you wanna go
And even going home
Dont you wanna go
Dont you wanna go
Dont you wanna go-o-o-o-o-o
