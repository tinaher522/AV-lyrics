<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Puttin'_On_The_Ritz">
If you're blue
And you don't know
Where to go to
Why don't you go
Where fashion sits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Different types
Who wear a day-coat
Pants with stripes
And cutaway coats
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Strolling up the avenue so happy
All dressed up
Just like an English chappie
Very snappy
Come, let's mix
Where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks
Or "umbrellas"
In their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper
Super-duper
Come, let's mix
Where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks
Or "umbrellas"
In their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on
Puttin' on
Puttin' on
Puttin' on the Ritz
