<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="All_That_I_Want">
Maybe you know
You should, cos it shows 
Got me looking at your lips
See through your clothes
I hold you goodbye,
just a little too long
We don't act like it's wrong
Say where you've been
You look to the side
Not in the eyes,
no not in his eyes anymore
His eyes
I know the secret,
skinned you alive
But the heart has chosen
All that I want
Is to pick you up
from out of that dress
Carry you to that desk
And feel the sin of your flesh
It's all that I want
Arching your back
With that look on your face
All that I need
is an hour and space
When did it change
I guess when we started
sweeping under carpets
I talk you to sleep
And no one will know
He hasn't a heart so he can't
change your soul anymore,
your soul
I know the secret,
skins you alive
But the heart has chosen
All that I want
Is to pick you up
and out of that dress
Carry you to that desk
And feel the scent off your flesh
Now I confess
Do you think of me less
Get it off your chest
But if you wear that dress
You do what you want
And I wanna tear your
clothes off, baby
But you'd be homeless
in your heart
All that I want
Is to pick you up
from out of that dress
Carry you to that bed
And feel the sin of your flesh
Now I confess
Do you think of me less
Get it off your chest
But if you wear that dress
You do what you want
