<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Last_Days_Of_Disco">
Stand by me,
I've been stood by you for ages.
Stay calm and carry on,
Maybe nothing's wrong.
Is it the comfort of
Dis-information or
Is it the freedom that you fear.
Said I'm the angel of liberation, love
For a second I believe her.
I'm all you'll hear, ahhhh
While you're here, ahhhhh.
Don't call it a comeback,
Look what I invented here
I thought it was easy,
They came and took it away from us.
The last days of disco.
All raved out,
Bitter is the pill of devotion.
Read between the noise,
All you disco boys (All you disco boys).
The fascination of
A boy and girl in love,
For a second I could see her.
In the mirrorball
The human animal,
I'm the creature that I fear.
I'm all you'll hear, ahhhh
While you're here, ahhhhh
Don't call it a comeback
Look what I invented here
I thought it was easy
They came and took it away from us.
The last days of disco
The last days of disco
The last days of disco
I'm all you'll hear, ahhhh
While you're here, ahhhhh.
Don't call it a comeback
We'll hold an event in here
This space is beautiful
I'll decide when it is over
So don't call it a comeback
Look what I invented here
I thought it was easy
They came and took it away from us.
The last days of disco.
The last days of disco.
The last days of disco.
