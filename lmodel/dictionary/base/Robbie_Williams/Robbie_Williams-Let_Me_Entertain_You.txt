<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Let_Me_Entertain_You">
Hell is gone and heaven's here
There's nothing left for you to fear
Shake your ass come over here, now scream
I'm a burning effigy
Of everything I used to be
You're my rock of empathy, my dear
So come on, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Life's too short for you to die
So grab yourself an alibi
Heaven knows your mother lied, mon chère
Separate your right from wrongs
Come and sing a different song
The kettle's on so don't be long, mon chère
So come on, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Look me up in the yellow pages
I will be your rock of ages
Your see through fads and your crazy phases, yeah
Little Bo-Peep has lost his sheep
He popped a pill and fell asleep
The dew is wet but the grass is sweet, my dear
Your mind gets burned with the habits you've learned
But we're the generation that's got to be heard
You're tired of your teachers and your school's a drag
You're not gonna end up like your Mum and Dad
So come on, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
He may be good, he may be outta sight
But he can't be here, so come around tonight
Here is the place where the feeling grows
You gotta get high before you taste the lows, so come on!
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you (entertain you)
So come on, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you (entertain you)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
