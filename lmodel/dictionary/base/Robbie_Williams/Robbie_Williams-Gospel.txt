<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Gospel">
I used to think about it
When I was a little one
All alone
Used to be so excited,
so excited
On my own
I used to think about it
When I was a little one
All alone
Used to be so excited,
so excited
In my home
You wouldn't believe it
Even if I told ya
This little girl with 
too much exposure
Big bad world,
eyes black like a raven
I knew right then
my soul needed saving
You were way out of
my league back then
Go anyway, be a man
I am 16 and I love you and
I'm standing on your step
I took a photograph in my mind
but I don't know where it's kept
I'm embarrassing and limited
with thoughts I have repressed
But I'm 16 and I love you and
I haven't lost it yet
I used to be about it
When I was a little one
All alone
Used to be so excited,
so excited
In my home
I used to think about it
When I was a little one
All alone
Used to be all about it,
all about it
On my own
You wouldn't believe it
Even if I told ya
This little girl had
too much exposure
Big bad world,
eyes black like a raven
I knew right then
my soul needed saving	
(This is the end)
You were way out of
my league back then
Go anyway, be a man
I am 16 and I love you and
I'm standing on your step
I took a photograph in my mind
but I don't know where it's kept
I'm embarrassing and limited
with thoughts I have repressed
But I'm 16 and I love you and
I haven't lost it yet
Let me be your gospel
Baby we've got history
Let me be your gospel
Baby we've got history
This is the end
(Let me be your gospel)
My faithful friend
(Baby we've got history)
The bitter end
(Let me be your gospel)
Coming home again
(Baby we've got history)
This is the end
Drink to you,
you always wished me well
And those that don't
Go fuck yourself
Drink to you,
you always wished me well
And those that don't 
Go fuck yourself
This is the end
