Co-caine
Co-caine
Look at the mess we all made of ourselves
I don't remember it well
Everyone trying to be someone else
I was someone else as well
But it's all right
When you're getting the show right
Co-caine
Co-caine
Can you recall all the cubicle scenes?
Didn't we talk well?
Professional northerners we might of been
We got a new walk as well
But it's all right
When you get your stroll right
Co-caine
Co-caine
Stuck in a lift with a vacuum nosepipe
Stuck where the god sights fronting star fight
Super Tony
Going too far Tony
And yes it's all about me again boys
This is the part where I do the northern way
Super Tony
Going too far Tony
Co-caine
Co-caine
Isn't it nice that our fingers make V's?
Let's throw 'em all night
I got a nose bleed and nobody cares
Up with the big heads
But it's all right
When you're so bright
Stuck in a lift with a vacuum nosepipe
Stuck where the god sights fronting star fight
Super Tony
Going too far Tony
And yes it's all about me again boys
This is the part where I do the northern way
Super Tony
Going too far Tony
And that what holier-than-I
But didn't I do well?
Shovelling snow with the best of the worst
People you know well
But it's all right
'Cause you're snow white
Stuck in a lift with a vacuum nosepipe
Stuck where the god sights fronting star fight
Super Tony
Going too far Tony
And yes it's all about me again boys
This is the part where I do the northern way
Super Tony
Going too far Tony
Co-caine
Co-caine
