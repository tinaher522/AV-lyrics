<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Shine_My_Shoes">
Another dawn, another day, 
another dollar to be made
I've got a pocket in my soul, 
where a little rock, a little roll, assimilate
And I don't care what you think you know
Bout who I am and how it goes
I've made it easy to be me, 
so yeah, it's easy to be me
And thats why I say
I know you can't stand me 
cos I make you so angry
more and more each day
hey, hey, hey
The way you don't love me, 
kinda makes you look ugly
Every word you say
hey, hey, hey
Come up and see me
ho, ho, ho,
I kinda like the abuse
There's no room in my bed
But while you're here, 
just bow your head,
and you can shine my shoes.
Shine my shoes.
Get out of my lane boy
You're not in my league
Some are born to thrive
and some to underachieve
Here's something that'll make you sick
I'm as happy as a pig in shit.
I've been amuzed, I've been admired
I've been amazed, I've been betrayed
That's why I say
I know you can't stand me cos I make you so angry
more and more each day
hey, hey, hey
The way you don't love me, kinda makes you look ugly
Every word you say
hey, hey, hey
Come up and see me
ho, ho, ho
If you can take the abuse
There's no room in my band,
but while you're here lend a hand 
and you can shine my shoes
Shine my shoes
kneel down boy
That's why you can't stand me
cos I make you so angry
more and more each day
hey, hey, hey
The way you don't love me, 
kinda makes you look ugly
Every word you say
hey, hey, hey
Come up and see me
ho, ho, ho,
I kinda like the abuse
There's no room in my bed
But while you're here, 
just bow your head,
and you can shine my shoes.
Shine my shoes.
Shine my shoes
Until I see my face
