<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Revolution">
(Robbie)Dont fight the feeling relax,
Oh child the knots are in your back,
cuz' you've been holding on,
I feel you when you are reaching out
(WomanI'll talk you through memories, 
just keep breathing with me,
It's time to hold my hand,
And walk in to the revolution,
(R)And there's no one to touch,
And you've been thinking too much,
You only hurt yourself,
When it's all about retribution
(W)I see the pain in your face,
And praying with of the space,
Its time to lead you on,
Come on, into revolution
And you can't keep on keepin' on,
And everything you lead upon is all but gone,
Everybody falls sometimes, but love shines on
And on And on And On...
With love in your eyes,
With a flame in your heart,
Gonna find yourself some resolution
(W)A million miles with one step
(R)You'll find yourself yet
Walking with the revolution
Get it on get it on get it on get it on
Talk about a revolution
Get it on get it on get it on get it on
(W)Rockin' with the revolution
Get it on get it on get it on get it on'
(R)Take you high yeahohh...
(R)Oh love lingers on,
Just feeling upon,
I know you're tired,
When it's time to sleep,
You come forever
(W)Make friends with your past,
And you can leave it at last,
It's time to run yourself,
Walking with the revolution
And you cant keep on keepin' on,
And everything you lead upon is all but gone
(W)All but gone
(R)Everybody hurts sometimes,
But love shines on
And On AND On And On
(R)Time and tides on your side,
There's no need to hide,
I feel your pain,
Dont talk to me about evolution
(W)A milion miles with one step,
(R)You'll find yourself again, When you're walking with the revolution
Walking the the revolution
(W)A milion miles with one step
And you'll find yourself again, When you're walking with the revolution
Get it on get it on get it on get it on
Walking with the revolution
Get it on get it on get it on get it on
(W)Can't warn you of the revolution
Get it on get it on get it on get it on
It's all about resolution
Get it on get it on get it on get it on
Talk About the revolution
