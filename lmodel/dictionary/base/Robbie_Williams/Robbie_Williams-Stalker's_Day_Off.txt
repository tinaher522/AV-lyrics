<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Stalker's_Day_Off">
I've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts
I hear when you shout
Cos I understand you see
I was concerned when you said
You'd rather wake up dead
Than spend a day with me
I know that's not you
I know and it's true
They don't understand you like I do
I've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts
I hear when you shout
Cos I understand you see
(spoken: hi, it's me again...yay, I got on parole! yeah, umm..if you could just..er..pick
Up the phone, I'd like to talk to you, please!)
I've seen misery
And have a strange empathy
With the woman who kidnaps her lover
This love ain't a dream
I know it's obscene
The calls that I left for your mother
I've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts
I hear when you shout
Cos I understand you see
(spoken: I love you, too...everyday...perhaps someday we could meet...face to face this
Time...*laughs...
I'm sorry about that letter I sent you...the newspaper cuttings and stuff...and blood...
*laughs*)
I've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts
I hear you when you shout
Cos I understand you see
Just tell me that you love me...
