<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="All_Climb_On">
All climb on
Whatever you've seen
Whatever it's done
All climb on
Whatever it takes
Whatever you're on
And the truth is we don't know
About how or why or where or when we go
Oh we must be very brave
I came here for eternity
It took my breath away
Then I was told I couldn't stay
All climb on
The bodies you've left
The battles you've won
Oh we're all born naked
It's not that complicated
I climb on
By chance of grand design
We were built to climb
It's a sign
Climb on
And the truth is we don't know
About how or why or where or when we go
In the end no matter what
I'm gonna make the most of what precious time I've got
From the cradle to the grave
To take those opportunities I must be very brave
Could it all be a mistake
Too scared to care
Too hurt to love
Enough
Climb on
Too scared to breathe
In here with me
My love
Climb on
It's my soul transmission
A higher calling, call it love
Climb on
All my life these visions
Telling me to keep on fighting
Climb on
Too scared to care
Too hurt to love
Enough
Climb on
Too scared to breathe
In here with me
My love
Climb on
