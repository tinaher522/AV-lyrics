<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="H.E.S.">
Brothers, if only God can judge us
Then who'll clear up the rubbish down here
'Cause they don't care for us
There's trouble crawling out of that rubble
The whole world's in a bubble I swear
And the shit that you were fed is in your head
It's the heavy entertainment show
See the world through its ancient eyes
We are living in the wildest times
I lost my mind a while ago
When and where I do not know
We are living in a world of lies                     
And we've been giving it its hardest fight   
In harmony down below
At the heavy entertainment show
Chief suspects the military conflicts
And bankers let genocide fly
We do what the man says then go to bed (then go to bed)
At the heavy entertainment show
See the world through its ancient eyes
We are living in the wildest times
I lost my mind a while ago
When and where I do not know
We are living in a world of lies
And we've been giving it its hardest fight
In harmony down below
At the heavy entertainment show
Hey good looking why don't you come over here
Tell me a few things that I wanna hear
You come whisper them inside of my ear
Tear down the walls make 'em disappear
I said hey good looking wo'nt you come my way
Still got a few songs left to play
And I got two tickets would you like to go
To the heavy entertainment show
See the world through its ancient eyes
We are living in the wildest times
I lost my mind a while ago
When and where I do not know
We are living in a world of lies
And we've been giving it its hardest fight
In harmony down below
At the heavy entertainment show
