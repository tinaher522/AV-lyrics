<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Love_Is_You">
If life is a shrine
I hook on temp for the divine
If not for my spine
I wouldn't see it through
Now I like the peace
Am waiting for a heart to speak
Oh girls and freaks so'd love to you
'Cause love is you, love is what you put me through
I am lost, you are too
Love is you
One minute that you fight
Then love would go and change its mind
I have lost all this truth
Loving you
Thought I had to say something
What I should have said is nothing
Kept it swept under the rug
You know I smear 'cause I'm in pain 'cause I made you sad
And you still don't understand at all
Love is you, love is what I'm going through
I have lost, you have too
Love is you
For me that you fight
Then love would go and change its mind
I have lost all that's true
Loving you
'Cause love is you, love is what you made me do
I have sinken, you were too
Love is you
One minute that you fight
Then love would go and change its mind
I have lost all that truth
Loving you
