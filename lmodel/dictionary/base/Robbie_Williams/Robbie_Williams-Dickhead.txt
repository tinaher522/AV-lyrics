<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Dickhead">
This is "T" to the motherf.ucking "Ofty" 
What's your problem Dickhead 
Don't kick my dog dickhead 
Don't beep at me dickhead 
Why'd you mug me off in my car dickhead 
Why you disrespecting my bra dickhead 
Theres a dickhead in your mouth 
A dickhead on parade 
Do not have kids 
Don't want dickheads to be made dickhead 
Why you disrespecting my bra dickhead 
Why'd you piss me off of this class dickhead 
I'm not sitting here to be treated like a dickhead 
Bumba Clads, King Raas Clads 
Where's the Chorus dickhead,give me my lighter
Isn't it lovely, we can still be good friends 
They say you've gone off me, don't be so sloppy..baby 
Isn't it lovely, that we can still be good friends 
I know you still want me, because I'm so lovely...baby 
If you diss me you'll sell copy dickhead 
What'd you expect dickhead 
Radiohead dickhead 
This is pop dickhead 
Size tens dickhead 
break your shins dickhead 
My security are a viscious crew 
They'll kick f.uck out of you 
Only if I ask them to, but 
They'll kick f.uck out of you 
You're going home in a Staffordshire Ambulance 
I wasn't looking at ya' bird dickhead 
She was looking at me dickhead 
Who do I think I am dickhead 
Who the f.uck are you dickhead 
You must have me confused 
With someone who gives a shit 
I've found the dickhead of the year 
And you are f.ucking it dickhead 
Where's the chorus...no chorus.. dickhead 
Isn't it lovely, we can still be good friends 
They say you've gone off me, don't be so sloppy..baby 
Isn't it lovely, that we can still be good friends 
I know you still want me, because I'm so lovely...baby 
This s.hit as bananas, B A N A N A S...hahaha
I've got a bucket of shit Ohh Yeah 
I've got a bucket of shit 
I've got a bucket of shit Ohh Yeah 
I've got a bucket of shit 
Not horse shit, cow shit dog shit no real shit 
I've got a bucket of shit Ohh Yeah 
I've got a bucket of shit 
I've got a bucket of shit Ohh Yeah 
I've got a bucket of shit 
Not dog shit, cow shit horse shit REAAL shit!
Can you do it again
Why'd you caught me up in my car dickhead 
Why'd you say bad things 'bout my bra dickhead 
I've got nothing for you dickhead 
Go to bed dickhead 
Don't wake up dickhead 
Who gives a f.uck dickhead 
No one gives a f.uck about you cos you're a dickhead true 
See your mate over there in the corner he's a dickhead too like you, dickhead 
Isn't it lovely, we can still be good friends 
They say you've gone off me, don't be so sloppy..baby 
Isn't it lovely, that we can still be good friends 
I know you still want me, because I'm so lovely...baby 
Isn't it lovely
I tell you what
There's one out every night 
It's not one, just like 
All do it and they're buggers 
I know you're calling it lalalala 
You sound like Snoopy 
A rugged Snoopy, woahhhhoooo 
Isn't it lovely 
You dickheads are spoiling it 
For tits like us 
Baby 
Dickhead
