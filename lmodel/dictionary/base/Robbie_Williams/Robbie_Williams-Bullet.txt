<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Bullet">
Well, it was years ago long before I'd ever met the queen
I would stay up all night and act like heaven was a place I'd already seen
And then you straddled me, like a bridge going somewhere good
And I looked at your eyes and I was like, oh my word
This is how I fell in love
(That was the moment when I)
No one ever near good enough
(That was the moment when I)
It started years ago long before I'd ever been to see
Us, hoping she would come and find, run and find me
But I was somewhere out of time, out of space, out of whack
(Never look back, never look back)
It's the unknown now, can never look back
(Never look back)
This is how I fell in love
(That was the moment when I)
No one ever near good enough
(That was the moment when I)
That's why
(This is what it feels like)
I fell
(This is what it feels like)
In love
(This is what it feels like)
And I hope it don't change
And I hope it stays the same
And I hope we do remain best friends
'Cause I love you more than life
Take a bullet for you
I swear, I swear
In a heartbeat
I'd jump in front of that gun
And take a bullet for you baby
(Take a bullet for you baby)
Instantly
(Take a bullet for you baby)
You're why
I fell in love
(Take a bullet for you baby)
And that's why
It hurts
(Take a bullet for you baby)
I'd take a bullet for you
I'd take a bullet for you
I'd take a bullet for you
I'd take a bullet for you
I adore you
(Take a bullet for you baby)
I adore you
(Take a bullet for you baby)
I love you
(Take a bullet for you baby)
You are why I fell in love
(That was the moment when I)
This is how I fell in love
(That was the moment when I)
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
