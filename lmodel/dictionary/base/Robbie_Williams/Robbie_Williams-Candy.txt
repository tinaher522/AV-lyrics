<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Candy">
I was there to witness Candice’s inner business
She wants the boys to notice her rainbows and her ponies
She was educated but could not count to ten
Now she got lots of different horses by lots of different men
And I say
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there’s water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she’s made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she’s made of candy
Ring a ring of roses, whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes as the war of the roses
Mother was a victim, father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton and learning how to fix them
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there’s water
As you win she’ll be the Hollywood love
And if it don’t feel good
What are you doing this for
Now tell me
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she’s made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she’s made of candy
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there’s water
As you win she’ll be the Hollywood love
And if you don’t feel good
What are you doing this for
What are you doing this for
What are you doing this for
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she’s made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she’s made of candy
