<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Starstruck">
You laugh at us, we're different,
And we laugh 'cause you're all the same.
By the look on your face baby,
We've been enjoying ourselves again.
I know that you cry.
I know why you tried so hard
Ready, steady, go,
Everybody famous,
Everyone you know,
Why'd it take you ages?
I don't have to listen, read, love like you,
I've got no problem with the physical, minimal real life.
Living in hysterica for everybody's betterment.
Isn't it a miracle, everybody starstruck.
I guess the odds are very good,
But the goods are very odd,
And even though I talk with the devil,
I only made the deal with god.
I am a long list,
Knock one off the wrist,
So hard.
Ready, steady, go,
Everybody famous,
Everyone you know,
Why'd it take you ages?
I don't have to listen, read, love like you,
I've got no problem with the physical, minimal real life.
Living in hysterica for everybody's betterment.
Isn't it a miracle, everybody starstruck.
You want to stop,
But you can't, can you?
I was lovely,
On the way up,
On the way up.
Ready, steady, go,
Everybody famous,
Everyone you know,
Why'd it take you ages?
I don't have to listen, read, love like you,
I've got no problem with the physical, minimal real life.
Living in hysterica for everybody's betterment.
Isn't it a miracle, everybody starstruck.
