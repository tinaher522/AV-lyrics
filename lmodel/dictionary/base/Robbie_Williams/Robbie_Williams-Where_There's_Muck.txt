<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Where_There's_Muck">
Oh, I could tell you
Please try and understand
'bout the ship left unmanned out at sea
The laughter there is canned
'cause the jokes are secondhand
God forbid I didn't blend this mutiny
Before the boat's a wreck
Send a dove to land on deck
'cause the noose around my neck is killing me
The anger makes me boil
The mistakes I make are royal
There's a sadness in the silent part of me.
Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass
Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass
I'm not asking you
I'm telling you
Kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaass
Don't tell me the truth
I know I've been uncouth
Well, my breath's a hundred proof, I cannot breathe
Calling ship to shore
Don't know what all the fuss is for
Save the women and the children after me
Before the boat's a wreck
Send a dove to land on deck
'cause the noose around my neck is killing me
The anger makes me boil
The mistakes I make are royal
There's a sadness in the silent part of me.
Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass
Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass
I'm not asking you
I'm telling you
Kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaass
My aaaaaaaaaaaaass
Would've been love, should've been love, could've been love, would've been love
Should've been love, would've been love, would've been love, should've been love
Would've been love, should've been love, could've been love, would've been love
Should've been love, would've been love, could've been love, should've been love
Could've been love, should've been love, could've been love, would've been love
Should've been love, would've been love, could've been love, should've been love
Would've been love, should've been love, could've been love, would've been love
Should've been love, would've been love, should've been love
Could've been loooooooooooooooove
