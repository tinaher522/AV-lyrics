<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="No_One_Likes_A_Fat_Pop_Stars">
I come from a land of kebabs and curries
Second helpings, no worries
Pile the carbs upon the plate
Then one day, it's too late
No breakfast, no luncheon
Just carpets I'm munching
A thimble of self-esteem
Glazed nothing for afters, an absence of laughter
The saddest that I've ever been
You just can't be portly, not this side of 40
Showbiz, a single chin game
Scum paparazzi's and weight police nasties
Have narrowed the hall of fame
No one likes a fat pop star
Pop is a place for the thin
No one likes a fat pop star
We want to hear thin people sing!
When I get faint, I chew through my restraints
It's the best meal that I've had all week
If I could eat my own words, I'd tear through the verbs
But nobody pays me to speak
No one likes a fat pop star
Pop is a place for the thin
No one like a fat pop star
We want to hear thin people sing!
Now you've upset me, I feel like a snack
A packet of Minstrels, a pie and a nap
So what's wrong with that?
No breakfast, no luncheon
Just carpets I'm munching
A thimble of self-esteem
Glazed nothing for afters, an absence of laughter
The thinnest that I've ever been
Thank you
