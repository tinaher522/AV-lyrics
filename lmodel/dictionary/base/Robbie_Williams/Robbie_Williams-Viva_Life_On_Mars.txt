<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Viva_Life_On_Mars">
I just wanna be,I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,I just wanna be,
I lost all faith in what I know, 
the future doesn't need me so
I kick a bow,again a woah
And yet until it don't hurt no more
Use my cuts and lacerations, feed
myself a new sensation, woah, woah
Take a ride on your high horse,
if the horse is blind, use the force
The falcon flies in two straight lines,
red five standing by
It's not a moon, it's a space station,
it feels good, the good vibration,
woah, woah
I know that you know
some lovely people
send them all an invitation,
party to a segregation, woah, woah
Viva life on Mars I'm calling,
sending my frequency to the galaxy
So you can see people down here
They don't want us to discuss
the picture in the caves of us
A nosebleed and a bag of coal,
then they put you in a hole
We're knee deep in information,
and they can't stop this
conversation, no, woah
I know that you know
some lovely people
Send them all an invitation,
party to a segregation, woah, woah
Viva life on Mars I'm calling,
sending my frequency to the galaxy
So you can see we're all down here
I just wanna be,I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,I just wanna be,
Love is natural, love is good,
not everybody does it but
everybody should
With them and us we've made a mess,
'til they decide which God is best
Free yourself from liberation from
Lake Geneva to the Freeland Station,
woah, woah
I know that you know
some lovely people
Send them all an invitation,
party to a segregation, woah, woah
Viva life on Mars I'm calling,
sending my frequency to the galaxy
So you can see people down here
Viva life on Mars I'm calling,
Viva life on Mars I'm calling,
Viva life on Mars I'm calling,
Viva life on Mars I'm calling
