<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Surrender">
I came in piece and I survived
I let the light destroy the lies
Till there's no bitterness inside
Then I be cane but I won't be cheap
There is no limit here for me
I'm taking everything I need
The world's alive
But it's
Run by feet
It's trying
Take your soul
Before you're leaving until
Break you down
If you
Don't break through
Take back control
When you feel like hope is gone
And there's no need to soldier on
No surrender
Don't you surrender, my love
I bite the world, the world bite back
This shout of love is not an act
And I care less if you don't understand
So when they'll send the symphony
It will be written just for me
The most joyest melody
Seek control
Avoid the pain
Wake up
And do it again
This is your home
This is your life
Take back control
When you feel like hope is gone
And there's no need to soldier on
No surrender
Now don't you surrender, my love
Cos you're not here for very long
So when you leave go with a song
No surrender
Let it be no surrender, my love
Treat me like a king
Kiss me like a stranger
Treat me like a king
Kiss me like a stranger
Treat me like a king
Kiss me like a stranger
Treat me like a king
Kiss me like a stranger
When you feel like hope is gone
And there's no need to soldier on
No surrender
Don't you surrender, my love
I bite the world, the world bite back
This shout of love is not an act
And I care less if you don't understand
No surrender
Let it be no surrender, my love
Treat me like a king
Kiss me like a stranger
Treat me like a king
Kiss me like a stranger
