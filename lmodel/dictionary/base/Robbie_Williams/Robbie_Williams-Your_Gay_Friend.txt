<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Your_Gay_Friend">
Woohoo!
Hey hey here comes noone
Another friend to have a go on
And she asks me do I miss her when shes gone
And I reply as much as I miss anyone
Oh! woohoo
And I'll be your gay friend
Cus your marriage never ends
Till we fuck and fight again
Theres a space between us
So jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a space between us
Hey lord forgive us if we're wrong
Make sure that he never hears this song
And she says that im the opposite of a hallmark card
She asked me how im feeling
When I dont want to think that hard
Oh! woohoo!
And I'll be your gay friend
Cus your marriage never ends
Till we fuck and fight again
Theres a space between us
Jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a space between us
It's the late show now
When does the late show end
When god is in the details
Forget to show my friend
I have a friend again
You my friend again
My gay friend
Oh! woohoo! erhh
So jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a space between us
And i'll be your gay friend
As your marriage never ends
Till we fuck and fight again
Theres a space between us
Oh! woohoo!
