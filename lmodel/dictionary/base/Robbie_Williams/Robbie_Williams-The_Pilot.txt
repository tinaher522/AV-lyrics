<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="The_Pilot">
Where's your head
maladjusted
There's no justice more or less
That be it said
Build on trust
It's all there
Since we must confess
Aaah
Have I lost you yeah
Aaah
Have I lost you
Oh yeah
Your love is the best
fly me
be the pilot
You can't be
Just lost cold demon 
You can't be
Just plain bad, come on
You can't be
Just lying in your bed
Lying there alone
It's not right babe
Aah 
Have I lost you yeah
Aah 
Have I lost you
Oh yeah 
Your love is the best
Fly me 
Be the pilot
Oh
Whereever you may go
Whatever you might do
I will catch your fall
I'll be there for you
When you're feeling weak
Not getting what you need
I will make you see
The love is best with me
We're unbeatable
Yes, my heart beats the rhythm inside of your chest
We're unbeatable
Yes, your heart beats the rhythm inside of my chest
Yes, my heart beats the rhythm inside of your chest
We're unbeatable
Yes, your heart beats the rhythm inside of my
Che-eest
Oh, yeah
Your love
fly me 
be the pilot
We're unbeatable
Yes, my heart beats the rhythm inside of your chest
We're unbeatable
Yes, your heart beats the rhythm inside of my chest
Yes, my heart beats the rhythm inside of your chest
We're unbeatable
Yes, your heart beats the rhythm inside of my
Che-eest
