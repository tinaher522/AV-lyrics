<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Bully">
Never test the temper of a patient man
You've been tryin to be understood &amp; boy do I understand
When you die, the world's gonna be lighter
See the heart of the champion, thru the, eye of the tiger
I simply don't care, if you hate me or love me
Pass me the pistol, shoot the bully
Hoo ha, hoo ha, hoo ha
The bully, the bully, the bully, the bully
Hoo ha
Had to hurt myself!
Shot myself again!
I can't make it up!
The bully, the bully, the bully, the bully
I'mma make it go away
I'mma make it disappear
Hell is empty, mama, the Devil's here
Look at you walkin' 'round like you're some kind of genius
Feel the steel, go tell it to Jesus
I've seen your soul, man, it's so ugly
Cock the pistol, shoot the bully
Hoo ha, hoo ha, hoo ha
The bully, the bully, the bully, the bully
Hoo ha
Had to hurt myself
Shot myself again
I can't make it up
The bully, the bully, the bully, the bully
I've seen your soul, man, it's so ugly
If they wanna know, tell them
I shot the bully
Hoo ha, hoo ha, hoo ha
The bully, the bully, the bully, the bully
