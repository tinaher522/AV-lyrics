<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="16_Tons">
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle an' blood
Muscle an' blood an' skin an' bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong
You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company sto'
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
Picked up the shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the strawboss said, "Well, bless my soul!"
You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company sto'
I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle names
I was raised in the canebrake by an' ol' mama lion
Can't no high-tone woman make me walk the line
You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company sto'
If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
With one fist of iron an' the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will
You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company sto'
