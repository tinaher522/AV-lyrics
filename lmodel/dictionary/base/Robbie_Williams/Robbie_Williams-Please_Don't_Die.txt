<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Please_Don't_Die">
Let me lie down
Please dont wake me
Nothings sacred
And noone save me
In my black eye
I can feel it
Moving
Closer
Cant you hear it
Only gift you gave to me
Was self-fullfilling prophecy
I need to change the sounds that shaped my life
And if you die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around theres noone here
To love me and hold me
Take me
Dancing
I love music
Keep on
Singing
We wont loose it
Picture me there
Missing noone
If your hearts run free
Why cant we go on
Go on to till they kick us out
We've everything to talk about
I could bring a song into your life
If you should die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around theres noone here
To love me and hold me
Maybe i been away to long
I know I'm not always right but is that wrong 
They say there is nothing i can do
But to talk to strangers and wait for you
If you should die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around theres noone here
To love me and hold me
And if you die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around theres noone here
To love me and hold me
Oooh ooh ooh!
