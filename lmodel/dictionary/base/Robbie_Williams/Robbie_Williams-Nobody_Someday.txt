<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Nobody_Someday">
I'm a gigolo
I'm Joseph
I'm a sad light of song
And everybody that I know
Are being known for being wrong
If I'm not mistaken
This is my heart breaking
I'm the man who threw it all away
Destiny is calling
Telling me to be boring
And I don't care anyway
Gonna be nobody someday
I'm a demon that you fear
I'm the joker
I'm the thief
I'm the lonesome cowboy riding
I'm the Indian chief
Gotta watch my figure
Boy, if I get much bigger
They'll stick a pin in me
And I'll blow away
But I get richer
But they take my picture
Taking my soul away
Gonna be somebody someday
Gonna be nobody someday
I'm a moonlight serenade
I'm your bed when you are cold
I'm the captain of Titanic
I'm the passenger in the hole
From the way I'm thinking
We'll both be sinking
I knew before we sailed away
At the tip of my ego
It's you saw anyway
Gonna be nobody someday
Gonna be somebody, la la
La la
