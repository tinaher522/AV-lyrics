<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="You_Know_Me">
If a man could be his own fantasy,
Then to only breed in captivity is pointless.
I've been doing what I like, 
When I like, how I like, it's joyless.
Only you know me.
What a waste of war this peace ,
Baby steps and two more sleeps,
Till I get to say sorry.
I get hysterical historicals of 'love is just chemicals'.
Give us something to stop me.
Only you know me.
Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday.
You don't know 'cause you're not there.
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away.
Only you know me.
I'm doin' fine,
And the sun often shines.
What are you thinking?
I done bruised up my mind
With this thunderbird wine
Baby, I'm drinking.
Only you know me.
Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday.
You don't know 'cause you're not there.
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away.
Only you know me.
Only you know me.
Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday.
You don't know 'cause you're not there.
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away.
Only you know me.
Only you know me.
Only you.
Only you.
Only you know me.
