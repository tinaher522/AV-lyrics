<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Summertime">
This is how I pray in the summertime
This is how I pray in the summer
Got my glass of shandy, now I feel fine
This is how I pray yeah
The more you say, the more you pray
The less it's getting you down
The more you pray, the more you stay
The less it's getting you down
All the time, leaves falling all around
Wintertime follows suit
Little bunnys freezing in the snow
Winter's such an ugly brute
Mid city blues gettin' you down
Take a brake from the strain
Get out your car, drink a glass of wine
Admit it, you feel great
It's the summertime
This is how I play in the summertime
This is how I pray in the summer
Got my glass of shandy, now I feel fine
This is how I pray
This is how I pray in the summertime
This is how we play in the summer
Got my glass of shandy, now I feel fine
This is how I pray yeah
And if your love has met it's sad refrain
Believe me, you will love again
All the best lain plans of mice n men go wrong
You can hear it in this song
This is how I pray for the summertime
This is how I play in the summer
What's mine is yours, yours is mine
This is how I pray yeeeaaahhhhhhh
Ohh ohh ohh
Yeeeaaahhhhhhh
You've got the funky drama in 89
This is how I play yeeaaahhh
Ohh ohh ohh
Oohhhhh oohhh
The monties, the roses, blockin' all your noses
Wearing baggy clothes and no buffalo poses
Bantallas, droppy looking fellas
Wilt up in the clubs, football fox no mallas
A doogie dreadlocks, buzzin up ya socks
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
So gimme French kiss I love you voodoo ray
I dream of santa anna on the road to mandalay
In the summertime
When the weather is hot
In the summertime
When the weather is hot
On my mind
In the summertime
When the weather ist hot
In the summertime
In the summertime
When the weather ist hot
On my mind
In the summertime
On my mind
I got shivers down my spine
On my mind
Happiness is surfacin
On my mind
On my mind
