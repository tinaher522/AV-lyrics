<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Won't_Do_That">
In this bag of stuff I brought to you
You didn’t mind sorting it through
You would never be the trouble and strife
If I made you my Swiss army wife
I could give this up, I could walk away
It doesn’t fill me up, it didn’t anyway
I won’t do that to you, won’t do that to you,
Do that to you, won’t do that to you
I don’t mind when the boys look at you
If I was them I’d be doin’ it too
I mean more to you than handbags and shoes
I’m so sorry there’s been a few
I don’t trust too much, I don’t love enough
But I’m giving up, all this giving up
I won’t do that to you, won’t do that to you,
Do that to you, won’t do that to you
Suddenly I’m not the jealous guy
Another sign that we’re doing it right
I could give this up, I could walk away
Cause you fill me up, each and every day
I promise that I won’t do that to you, won’t do that to you,
Do that to you, won’t do that to you
Won’t do that to you, won’t do that to you,
Do that to you, won’t do that to you
I won’t do that to you, won’t do that to you,
Do that to you, wont do that to you
Won’t do that to you, won’t do that to you,
Do that to you, won’t do that to you
