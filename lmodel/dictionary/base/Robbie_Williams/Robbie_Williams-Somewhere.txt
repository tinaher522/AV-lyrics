<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Somewhere">
Somewhere there's a place where you can go
Someplace you can lay your heavy head down
Everybody needs somewhere to go
We don't get high to get a come down
You take your chance in life
Go out and find a wife
Don't get stuck in the state I'm in
Someone
Somewhere
Is loving you
