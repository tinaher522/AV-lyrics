<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="They_Can't_Take_That_Away_From_Me">
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
I ain't flat, the band, sharp
The way you haunt my dreams
Oh, no, they can't take that away from me
We may never, never meet again
On this bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always
Keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
Oh, no, they can't take that away from me
No, no, they can't take that away from me
Not without a lawyer anyway
We may never, never meet again
On this bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always
Keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
Oh, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away
No they won't take that away
Can't take that away, can't take that away
Won't take that away, won't take that away
Can't take that away from me, yeah
