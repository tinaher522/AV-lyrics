<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="These_Dreams">
She lies on her bed
With her hands in her head 
And she screams
He gets a kick out of losing the plot so
It seems
CHORUS
These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down
You never stopped loving his misfortunate
Lazy ways
All the memories that you should've had
Are a cabaret haze
There's just a hole where you know he
Should've been
There's no one worse off than you
When you can't describe what you've seen
REPEAT CHORUS
Where do you go when you're all alone
In your bed
Do you cry in your sleep 'cos it's 
Better unsaid
Have you forgotten your past because
That's how it seems
Is it too hard to think so you edit
Your dreams
And play them back again and again
REPEAT CHORUS
These dreams have let you down 
Take it don't break it just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down
you've got tomorrow tomorrow
you've got tomorrow tomorrow
you've got tomorrow tomorrow
you've got tomorrow tomorrow
you've got tomorrow tomorrow
