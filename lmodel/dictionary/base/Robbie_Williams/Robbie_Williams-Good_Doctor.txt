<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Good_Doctor">
Can we do it again
Take that, take that
Chorus
You alright star
No star
You alright star
You alright star
No star
I don 't feel proper
1st Verse
I went to the Dr. to get a prescription
I told him little fact and lots of fiction
About a bad back that I ain't got
He tried to sell me faith healing
But I think not
I want Xanax, Vicodin and Oxycontin
Funky fill the form out
So I can drop em'
I've got all these demons
And I can't stop em'
To tell you the truth Doc
I might have a problem
Robert Williams take one Adoral with water in the morning
As if I'm goin' to take one tablet I'm Keith Moon
Dick head
Chorus 2
He said this one's to take you up
Wow how
He said this one's to take you down
When I take um I don't feel sound
And I look rather Round
You alright star
No star
You alright star
No star
You alright star
No star
I don 't feel proper
2nd Verse
You know what Doc its alright and all
I just heart me leg its not terminal
But a pain killer could help for whats wrong with my knee
And I'm a little bit down from too much tea
Got me own collection can't get an erection
If I take em' too long they'll f**k me complextion
That's right If I take em for like more than a few days I get that haunted look
Give me loads of pills
Give me loads of pills
Give me loads of pills
Give me loads of pills
Chorus 3
He said this one's to take you up
Wow how
He said this one's to take you down
Wow how
When I take um I don't feel sound

And I look rather Round
You alright star
No star
You alright star
No star
You alright star
Five star
I don't feel proper
Middle 8 ish
Now if you go to the barber shop long enough then you're gonna' get a hair cut
And if go to the doctors regular, then you gots to be a f**k up
Well I've got 5 or 6 if I'm at a loss
Do I have a history of drug abuse, well I never tick that box
And I now that some of you are going to be really really cross
The drug's stop working so prescription pills are boss
The glory days are gone and we've all stopped havin' it
No raves no more just bedside cabinet
Sleepers are great but don't start dabbing it
The world carries on spinning we're mad in it
Take that, take that
Chorus 3
He said this one's to take you up
Wow how
He said this one's to take you down
Wow how
When I take um I don't feel sound
And I look rather Round
You alright star
No star
You alright star
No star
You alright star
Five star
I don't feel proper
You alright star
No star
Are you five star
No star
You alright star
Five star
I don't feel proper
Know what doc, it's not like I've been doin' any research or anything
But if you can give me any of the following pills
I'd be very very greatful cos I feel poorly
So that's
Codeine
Morphine
Opium
Methadone
Menocrabedene
Hydroanoxycodeine
Anolodene
Buprenorphine
ButroPhenol

Dorel
Work with me antidepressants
