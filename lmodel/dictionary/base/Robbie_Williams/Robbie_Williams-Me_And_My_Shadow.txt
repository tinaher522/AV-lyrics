<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Me_And_My_Shadow">
(Spoken)
Robbie: (american accent) Johnny and Robbie
Jonathan: Youth, why are you you talking like that
We're from Stoke
Robbie: I know, but I can't stop here pally
Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall
Like the seashore clings to the sea
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow
No you'll never get rid of me
Let all the others fight and fuss
Whatever happens, we've got us
(Me and my shadow)
We're closer than pages that stick in a book
We're closer than ripples that flow in a brook
(Strolling down the avenue)
Wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look
Closer than a miser or the bloodhounds to Liza
(Me and my shadow)
We're closer than smog gets to all of L.A
We're closer than Ricky to confessing he's gay
Not a soul can bust this team in two
We stick together like glue
Haha when it's sleeping time
That's when we rise
We start to swing
(Ooh, you think you're so jazz you...)
Our clocks don't chime
What a surprise
They ring-a-ding-ding
Happy New Year
(Me and my shadow)
And now to repeat what I said at the start
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart
We're alone but far from blue
Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit a few late spots, and then a few more
We'll start up at Stringy's and maybe Groucho
Life is gonna be wow-wow-wee
For my shadow and me
(Spoken)
Jonathan: Can we do that again?
Robbie: No, I'm too tired
Jonathan: Oh, please Rob?
Robbie: No, I'm swung out
Jonathan: Oh, come on, I'll give you some money
Robbie: I don't need money..
Jonathan: How 'bout a cup of tea?
Robbie: I'm not thirsty
Jonathan: I won't tell anyone you're gay
(Laughter)
Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit all the late spots, and then a few more
We'll start out at Stringy's and maybe Groucho
Life is gonna be wow-wow-wee
For my shadow and me
