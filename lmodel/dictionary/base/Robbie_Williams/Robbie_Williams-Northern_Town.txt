<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Northern_Town">
In a northern town
In a northern town
We were getting down
In a northern town
We were getting down
Having good times
Having good, good times
In a northern town
In a northern town
Get together, have some good times, baby, can you feel it?
Have a good time
Good time's coming to you
Good times, good times
I was dancing, I was singing, good times
In a northern town
In a northern town
We were getting down
In a northern town
We were getting down
Having good times
Having good, good times
In a northern town
In a northern town
Get together, have some good times, baby, can you feel it?
All alone, all alone
But I'm all alone now
But I'm all alone now
We're good friends having good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
