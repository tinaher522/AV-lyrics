<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Eine_Tasse_Tee">
The time was near 
I had to go 
I couldnt just leave
and let you go
How was i supposed to live
How was i supposed to breathe
You know that it's you

There's no one but you
So close the door 
turn out the light
lets think about what should be right 
Love
