<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="The_Edge">
I used to wander to the edge and look down
I used to pile up promises then leave town
You should've heard my best excuses so profound and so untrue
But now I wake up next to you
Each time I slip feels like the world conspires
To underline my most impure desires
Thought all of those who swear by love they were mental through and through
But now I wake up next to you
And the nights are sill as long as they ever were
All the things that could go wrong, well they still occur
But when the violent sun breaks the morning air it will find me there
Next to you
I had to lose myself for years to find this
Mistook the cruelty and abuse for kindness
Didn't know yet what to keep zipped shut, my own blindness stole the view
But now I wake up next to you
And the nights are still as long as they ever were
And all things that could go wrong, well they still occur
But when the violent sun breaks the morning air it will find me there
Next to you
Where did it all go right?
When did it all go right?
When did it all go right?
Where did it all go right?
I used to wander to the edge and look down
I used to pile up promises then leave town
You should have heard my best excuses so profound and so untrue
But now I wake up next to you
When did it all go right?
I'll always walk back from the edge
And find a way to you
Where did it all go right?
I'll always walk back from the edge
Find a way to get to you
When did it all go right?
I'll always walk back from the edge
And find a way to you
Where did it all go right?
I'll always walk back from the edge
Find a way to get to you
