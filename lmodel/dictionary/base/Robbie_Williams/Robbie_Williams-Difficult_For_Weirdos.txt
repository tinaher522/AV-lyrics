<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Difficult_For_Weirdos">
We’re the futurists in the bistro
Where the music is for weirdos
We like it different, we like it strange
In our own way, we haven’t changed
I got my eyes made up at the bus stop
By my girlfriend, and you know what
She likes me different, she likes me strange
In her own way, she’s just the same
Psycho evolution, your pollution makes it difficult for weirdos
Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town
Every Saturday, at the plaza
Guess the gender, unless you’d rather
He is a lesbian, but that’s okay
She is the center of attention for another day
In the universe, we are magenta
You can join us if you enter
Because you’re different and you are strange
In your own way you’re just the same
Psycho evolution, your pollution makes it difficult for weirdos
Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town
Time isn’t lost where devotion is
I never wasted a life
Space is the place where the social is
Far from the safe and the norm
In the off-stream they call it cabaret, but they’ll say that, won’t they?
I want it different, I like it strange
In my own way I haven’t changed
It’s insulting to be mislead by the hairdo of the godhead
They show irreverence, but that’s OK
We are the center of the universe anyway
Psycho evolution, your pollution makes it difficult for weirdos
Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town
Psycho evolution, your pollution makes it difficult for weirdos
Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town
Psycho evolution, your pollution makes it difficult for weirdos
Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town
