<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Kiss_Me">
In my young life I have received
Callers though they were Christmas Eve
I'm disappointed and I don't know why
She gave me laughter and hope, and a sock in the eye
In my young life I know something 
Now, I've never tried to create a wow
Wows are few, frustration more common
Now I can feel in my soul that's why gave the come-on
Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
But wine is all I have
Will your love ever be mine?
Faces fall before my feet
Like blood onto a clean white sheet
When I grow old I won't forget
To innocence my only debt
Wow I feel so fresh today
Barefoot in the snow, to make love in the hay
The stars are bright in the abyss
Now I can feel ya in my arms, I explode inside your kiss
Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
But wine is all I have
Will your love ever be mine?
(kiss me)
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
(cos - cos - cos- cosmic forces)
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
But wine is all I have
Will your love ever be mine?
