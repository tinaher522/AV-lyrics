<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Not_Like_The_Others">
You do something that
reminds me
The days of rage
are not behind me
I have to
Live outside the law
Cos I'm a naughty boy
with a dirty habit
Trying to use some
teenage magic
Picking pennies off the floor
When she comes
She comes for hours
Stun
She don't fake for no one
She don't fake for no one
And if love 
Gets in the way of you
Let's do what we're
supposed to do
And all lay low
Oh baby please
Beggin you darling please
Under the covers
You and me are
not like the others
You and me are
not like the others
Please
Beggin you darling please
God loves a lover
You and me are
not like the others
You and me are
not like the others
You do something
that reminds me
I've no resistance,
follow blindly
Baby that's what
I came here for
Cos you pull me out
of my sedation
Practice high street meditation
And other sexual metaphors
So when you come
You come for hours
Stun
No, I don't fake for no one
She don't fake for no one
And if love gets in
the way of you
Let's do how we
supposed to do
And fall in love
Oh baby please
Beggin you darling please
Under the covers
You and me are
not like the others
You and me are
not like the others
Please
Begging you darling please
God loves a lover
You and me are
not like the others
You and me are
not like the others
We are not like the others
Under, under the covers
God loves, God loves a lover
We are not like the others
We are not like the others
Under, under the covers
God loves, God loves a lover
We are not like the others
Please
Beggin you darling please
Under the covers
You and me are
not like the others
You and me are
not like the others
Please
Beggin you darling please
God loves a lover
You and me are
not like the others
You and me are
not like the others
