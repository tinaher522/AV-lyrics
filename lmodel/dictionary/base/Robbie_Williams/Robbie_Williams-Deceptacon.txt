<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Deceptacon">
Microwave yourself today,
Save you for a rainy day.
Hello deceptacon,
This will not be going away.
From all of us there,
To all over here,
We wish you all of the best,
All of the year.
She said, "Well he’s never been quite right".
And I know, we’ll be stepping on eggshells tonight.
And all over Britain,
We wait for permission,
To form another queue.
We stand in position,
Though someody’s missing,
And that somebody's you.
But what can I do?
"I love you but I don’t like you right now",
Was all she had to say.
Hello deceptacon,
I will not be going away.
From all of us here,
To all over there,
We wish you all of the best,
All of the year.
She said, "Only you could make it right".
But I’ve stopped, stepping on eggshells tonight.
And all over Britain,
We wait for permission,
To form another queue.
We stand in position,
Though someody’s missing,
And that somebody's you.
But what can I do?
Send my best to all concerned.
I know I’ve been a gracious host.
Goodbye deceptacon.
Who are you? (x3)
What are you, to me?
What can I do for you?
What can you do for me?
Who are you? (x3)
What are you, to me?
