<song artist="Robbie_Williams" title="Raver">
A is for absolutely everybody
And at first light
B is for brilliant and broke
Nearly all of the time
C is for coming on strong
Cos everyone knows
Till the death of it all
We're not going home
You' set out to dance
Real hard to find
Only the brave, expanding the mind
You were hands in the air
Cos love was the drug
You breaking the law
Making it up
The DJ said "Raver, get off the speaker
You're blocking the laser for the dance off
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway
These are the days that make sense of my life
Like a galaxy rising into the night
I get a little bit high and then loaded alone
I am not going home
I go out dancing, raving with strangers,
Unwound emotion on the dance floor
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway
One scream for the last romantic
One heart for the last romantic
One hope for the last romantic
One scream one dream
Yeah
We're the shit that's on the radio
We're the shit that's on the radio
We're the shit that's on the radio
We're the shit that's on the radio
I would go dancing, raving with strangers
Unwound emotion on the dance floor
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway
I ran with the runaways, runaways, runaway
One scream for the last romantic
One heart for the last romantic
One hope for the last romantic
One scream one dream
Yeah
One scream for the last romantic
One heart for the last romantic
One hope for the last romantic
One scream one dream
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
