<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="These_Arms_Are_Open_All_Night">
Well, it's closing time, I got no place to go
No, I'm not tired; nobody's waiting at home
Hey, what about you? Looks like you're leaving alone
Guess that makes two - me and you
By the way, my name's Jones
I know a place not far from here
That's my dented red Chevy out front
You can follow me there
There's no neon lights
It don't stink of beer
It's just a mile up the road
Just a minute from here
These arms are open all night
If you need someone to talk to
A hand to hold onto
And if it feels alright
These arms are open all night
The band is through, they're breaking down the drums
The took the singer's keys, man, he was really drunk
They're turning on the lights, we can't stay here no more
I can take a hint, find my way out the door
So what do you think? Are you going my way?
There's still a whole lot left to this night
Baby, what do you say?
There's no neon lights
It don't stink of beer
It's just a mile up the road
Just a minute from here
These arms are open all night
If you need someone to talk to
A hand to hold onto
And if it feels alright
These arms are open all night
God only knows how long it's been that I been so lonely
Back there at the stop sign
I see her headlights
I think she's coming with me
There's no neon lights
It don't stink of beer
It's just a mile up the road
Just a minute from here
These arms are open all night
If you need someone to talk to
A hand to hold onto
And if it feels alright
