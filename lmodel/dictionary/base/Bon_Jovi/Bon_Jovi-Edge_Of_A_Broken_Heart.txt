<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Edge_Of_A_Broken_Heart">
And there I stood, just like a soldier 
I was tough, until I saw her 
I said Hello, but she just turned away 
Hey Romeo, whatcha doin' with my girl, 
who are you using now, well I turn and walk away (Turn and walk away) 
I'm gonna please her, now you can believe it 
I'll be there to catch her when she falls 
Oooo, here I am (On the edge of a broken heart) 
I'm a man (On the edge of a broken heart) 
Here we stand (On the edge of a broken heart) 
So run if you can 'cause you know 
I'm a man on the edge (On the edge of a broken heart) 
I'm on the edge (On the edge of a broken heart) 
I'm on the outside, looking inside 
You're with him, who's on the wrong side now 
Do you still think of me 
I've tried to call, but no one answers 
Two silhouettes, a private dancer 
Lights go dim, as the music starts to fade, away (Turn and walk away) 
I'm the one who needs you, now you can believe it 
I'll be there to catch you when you fall 
Ooo you better believe I'm the man (On the edge of a broken heart) 
Here I am (On the edge of a broken heart) 
And we stand (On the edge of a broken heart) 
So run if you can 'cause you know 
I'm a man on the edge (On the edge of a broken heart) 
I'm on the edge (On the edge of a broken heart) 
Ooohh 
And when I hold out my hands I'll be reaching for you 
I give it all that I've got, that's all I can do 
When you're waiting for love 
I'll be waiting for you (On the edge of a broken heart) 
Only for you (On the edge of a broken heart) 
Oh baby for you (On the edge of a broken heart) 
So run if you can, you know 
I'm a man on the edge (On the edge of a broken heart) 
I'm on the edge (On the edge of a broken heart) 
I'm on the edge (On the edge of a broken heart) 
I'm on the edge (On the edge of a broken, broken, broken, broken etc.)
