<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Fear">
I see you looking over your shoulder
Tell me who do you think's out there
You're reaching for your four leaf clover
But baby, there ain't no luck down there
I swear that there's no heart in this city
It's here the slogan reads "Do your time"
Everybody's doing their sentence
It's just there ain't nobody here who knows just what's the crime
I watched my father live and die here
I'd rather die than fade away
I read the rules and then I know them
You ain't ever gonna make me play the game of
Fear, fear, fear
Of a new thing
Running with the rats through the city 
Makes you feel like you're a partner in crime
Girl, once you were young and pretty
Now won't you stop to watch that little girl die
Hey baby, won't you stop and hear me?
Just being here we're breathing heart attacks, yeah
We can run and chase the setting sun
We can run and we won't ever look back, no
Take my hand, I know we'll make it
I'll let nothing slow us down
I know you want to curse this place
There's only one thing that's stopping us now
It's fear, fear, fear
Of a new thing
Fear, fear, fear
Of a brass ring
You ain't one for taking chances 
You work and you live and you breathe nine to five
Still that's what you call living, ha
Man, that's surviving to me 
And surviving is living to die
In fear, fear, fear
Of a new thing
Fear, fear, fear
Of a brass ring
Fear, fear, fear, fear
Fear, fear, fear, fear
Fear
