<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Damned">
I'm lying here beside you in someone else's bed 
Knowing what we're doing's wrong 
But better left unsaid 
Your breathing sounds like screaming 
It's all that I can stand 
His ring is on your finger 
But my heart is in your hands 
Damned if you love me 
Damned if you don't 
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go 
Damned if you don't need me 
Damned if you do 
Oh God, I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes 
Damned, damned 
A door slams like a shotgun, you jump up to your feet 
But it's just the wind that's blowing through those secrets that we keep 
Made me want to want you, God knows I need to need you 
By the time the love is over, I'll be sleeping on the streets 
Damned if you love me 
Damned if you don't 
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go 
Damned if you don't need me 
Damned if you do 
Oh God, I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes 
Damned, damned 
Why don't you talk to me? ('Cause I'm too blind to see) 
Why don't you look at me? ('Cause I'm afraid to breathe) 
What do you want from me? (All that I can stand) 
The lies are on my tongue and I can't turn back I know 
My soul is damned 
Don't worry 
I ain't gonna call you or hear you say my name 
And if you see me on the streets, don't wave, just walk away 
Our lives are getting twisted, let's keep our stories straight 
The more that I resist it, my temptation turns to fate 
Damned if you love me 
Damned if you don't 
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go 
Damned if you don't need me 
Damned if you do 
God, I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes
