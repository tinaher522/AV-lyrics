<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Have_A_Nice_Day">
Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you help me try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived a lie, its just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang on to
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say "have a nice day"
Have a nice day
Take a look around you, nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake your helping hand
Everybody brave enough to take a stand
I knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness, and what's left to believe?
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang on to
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I'll show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say "have a nice day"
Have a nice day
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang on to
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I'll show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say "have a nice day"
Have a nice day
When the world keeps trying to drag me down
I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground
I say "hey! Have a nice day"
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
