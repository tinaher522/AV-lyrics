<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Bells_Of_Freedom">
I have walked all alone
On these streets I call home
Streets of hope, streets of fear
Through the sidewalk cracks time disappears
I was lost, on my knees
On the eve of defeat
As I choked back the tears
There's a silent scream no one could hear
So far away from everything you know is true
Something inside that makes you do what you got to do
Ring the bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the Bells of Freedom
When your world's crashing down
Like you've lost every round
Stand your ground
And ring the Bells of Freedom
Up the steps of the church
Through the fields and the dirt
In the dark I have seen
That the sun still shines for the one who believes
So far away 
So full of doubt and needing proof
Just close your eyes and hear the sounds inside of you
Ring the bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the Bells of Freedom
When your world's comes crashing down
Like you've lost every round
Stand your ground
And ring the bells of freedom
Ring the bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the Bells of Freedom
Yeah, when your world comes crashing down
Like you've lost every round
Stand your ground and ring the Bells of Freedom
Ring them bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the Bells of Freedom...
