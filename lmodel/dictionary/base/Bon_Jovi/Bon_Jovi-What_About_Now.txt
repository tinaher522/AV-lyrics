<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="What_About_Now">
You wanna start a fire?
It only takes a spark
You gotta get behind the wheel
If you ever gonna drive that car
If you wanna take a bite
You'd better have the teeth
If you're wanna take that step
Then get up off from your knees
'Cause tonight, we're alive
Who stand for the restless 
and the lonely?
For the desperate 
and the hungry?
Down for the count
I'm hearing you now
For the faithful, the believer,
for the faceless and the teacher
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?
You wanna start a fight?
You gotta take a swing
You gotta get your hands in the dirt
to see what the harvest will bring
You wanna raise you voice?
Don't be scared to breath
Don't be afraid to hurt
Don't ashamed in need
'Cause tonight, we're alive
Who stand for the restless 
and the lonely?
For the desperate 
and the hungry?
Down for the count
I'm hearing you now
For the faithful, the believer,
for the faceless and the teacher
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?
Bridge:
Believe for that reason 
that drift through the seasons
'Till dreams are just paint dark and grey
And all of your plans 
that slip right through your hands
Are just things that you take to your grave
Tonight, we're alive
Who stand for the restless, 
the lonely?
For the desperate 
and the hungry?
Down for the count
I'm hearing you now
For the faithful, the believer,
for the faceless and the teacher
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?
What about now?
What about now?
What about now?
