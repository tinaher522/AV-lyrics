(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
Young and wired
Set to explode in the heat
You won't tire
'Cause baby was born with the beat
Take you higher than you've ever known
Then drive you down to your knees
I'll pick you up when you've had enough
You been burned baby lessons learned
(In and out of love)
Hear what I'm sayin'
(In and out of love)
It's the way that we're playing
(In and out of love)
Too much is never enough
She's gonna get to ya
Running wild
When me and my boys hit the streets
Right on time
She's here to make my night complete
Then I'm long gone I got another show
One more town, one mile to go
One endless night of fantasy
Is all she left of her with me
(In and out of love)
Hear what I'm sayin'
(In and out of love)
It's the way that we're playing
(In and out of love)
When we're together
(In and out of love)
It's too much for ever
(In and out of love)
Hear what I'm sayin'
(In and out of love)
It's the way that we're playing
(In and out of love)
Too much is never enough
She's gonna get to ya
"Ahahahahaha"
"Hey David, what are you doin'?"
"Biggest brown eyes I ever seen"
"Oh baby"
"Hey baby, wanna take a ride on the bus?"
"With your mom"
Out of love
Out of love
Out of love
Out of love
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love) Love!
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love)
(In and out of love) You want me to meet your what?
(In and out of love) Your daddy is who?
(In and out of love) Hey, just how old are you anyway?
(In and out of love) Oh, no
(In and out of love)
