<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="You_Give_Love_A_Bad_Name">
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven and put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Whoa-oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Whoa-oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A schoolboy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Whoa-oh, you're a loaded gun
Whoa-oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love, oh
Ohh, shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)
(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)
(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)
(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)
