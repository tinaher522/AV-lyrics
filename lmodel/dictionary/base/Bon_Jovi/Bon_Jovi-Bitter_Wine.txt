<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Bitter_Wine">
We met some time ago, when we were almost young 
It never crossed my mind to ask, where did you come from? 
I didn't have much money, so I stole you a rose 
You were dressed like an orphan, in Salvation Army clothes 
I never thought I'd lose you, no - I'd rather go blind 
I thought I saw the future, but the fortune teller lied 
I guess she lied 
You're love was my salvation, it could always get me high
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine
I know I wasn't funny, but you laughed at all my jokes 
When I was chaking on the words to say 
You shoved your finger down my throat 
The first night I said I loved you, you told me to go to hell 
You were giving he head, on that creeky Old bed at the Ol'Duvol Motel 
Just like everything, even good love has to die 
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye 
You're love was my salvation, it could always get me high
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine
Oh, yeah
Just like everything, good love has to die 
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye 
No, won't even cry
we're one of a kind
one of a kind, hey yeah
Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine
You're love was my salvation, it could always get me high
You take the back holy water, now all thats left is bitter wine
