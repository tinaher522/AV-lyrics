<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I've_Got_The_Girl">
It feels like I'm walkin' on air
When we walk down our street
When the neighbors stop to watch us walk by
You can hear 'em talking
(Let them talk)
Sometimes I think that you're the only reason the sun still shines
(When it shines)
And when this wicked world starts bringing me down
I know that I'm one lucky guy
I got the girl
(With all the cards)
I got the girl
(She's a work of art)
I got the girl
(Who's gonna break my heart)
She says that someday, she's gonna marry me
When that day comes, that we walk down the aisle
She'll make me feel like a prince, a lord or a king
She likes to wear her stripe with her plaids
And she won't brush her hair
(I swear)
She don't like wearing shoes in December but I don't care
(I don't care)
I got the girl
(With all the cards)
I got the girl
(She's a work of art)
I got the girl
(Who's gonna break my heart)
If I was a holy man, I'd get down on my knees
So the angels that watch over her, would give a break to me
Holy mother of saint bubble gum and sister band-aid knees
Won't you please pray for the ones like me?
But the truth is someday, somebody is gonna take her
(You see)
But the queen of hearts will always be
A five-year-old princess to me
(To me)
I got the girl
(With all the cards)
I got the girl
(She's a work of art)
I got the girl
(Who's gonna break my heart)
I got the girl
(She's gonna leave her mark)
I got the girl
(She's a work of art)
I got the girl
(She's gonna break your heart)
I got the girl
