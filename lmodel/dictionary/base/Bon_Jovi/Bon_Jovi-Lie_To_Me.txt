<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Lie_To_Me">
Rumor has it that your daddy's coming down; he's gonna pay the rent 
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get? 
It feels like there's a stranger standing in these shoes 
But I know I can't lose me, 'cause then I'd be losing you 
I know I promised baby I would be the one to make our dreams come true 
I ain't too proud of all the struggles and the hard times we've been through 
When this cold world comes between us, please tell me you'll be brave 
'Cause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away 
If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you don't love me baby - lie to me 
Pour another cup of coffee, babe; I got something to say to you
(I don't wanna lie no more)
I ain't got the winning ticket, not the one that's gonna pull us through 
(I don't wanna die no more)
No one said that it'd be easy; let your old man take you home 
But know that if you walk out on me that darling, I'd be gone 
If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me 
Baby, I can take it 
Oh...
It's a bitch, but life's a roller coaster ride 
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes 
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone 
But we gotta go around again, so let's hold on 
If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me 
Go on, lie to me 
Baby, I can take it 
C'mon, lie to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Go on, lie to me
Go on, lie to me
Lie to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Go on, lie to me
Tell me everything's gonna be alright
C'mon, get me through the night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
