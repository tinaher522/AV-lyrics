<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Broken_Promiseland">
Angels falling from the sky
Imagine that, imagine that
Nobody's getting out of here alive
No turning back, no turning back
Who's gonna bail out all our shattered dreams
And scrape some truth off of these city streets?
No time for praying, get up off your knees
There's hope I know, out on that lonely road
'Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in, breathe out, there's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of broken promiseland
Let's close our eyes and just disappear
Slip through the cracks, no looking back
We'd get a million miles away from here
And let the past just fade to black
So what you learn to live with your regrets?
No need to fear what hasn't happened yet
Well I'll forget you but you can't forget
There's hope I know, out on that lonely road
'Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in, breathe out, there's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of broken promise land
So rise my fallen angel
Come on now, come on now
Shine, don't let 'em break you
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on
There's hope I know, out on that lonely road
'Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in, breathe out, there's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of broken promiseland
Breaking out of broken promiseland
Breaking out of broken promiseland
