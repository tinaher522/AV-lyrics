<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="It">
This ain't a song for the broken hearted
No silent prayer for the faith departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice, when I shout it out loud
It's my life, it's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life, my heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive, it's my life
And this is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
It's my life and it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life, my heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive 'cause it's my life
You better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
It's my life and it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life, my heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life, and it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life, my heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive, 'cause it's my life
