<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Because_We_Can">
I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I’m here to take a stand
Because we can
She’s in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black &amp; white
Right now she’s missing those technicolor kisses
When it just ain't alive
Lately feeling like a broken promise
In the middle staring down this town
There’s only one thing in this world that she knows
He said forever and he’ll never let her down
I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I’m here to take a stand
Because we can
She laid take out on the coffee table
Prepped the dishes poured a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
Here for the moment everything is alright
I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I’m here to take a stand
Because we can our love can move a mountain
Because we can if you believe in we
Because we can just wrap your arms around me
Because we can we can
I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I’m here to take a stand
I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I’m here to take a stand
Because we can our love can move a mountain
Because we can if you believe in we
Because we can just wrap your arms around me
Because we can we can
Because we can
