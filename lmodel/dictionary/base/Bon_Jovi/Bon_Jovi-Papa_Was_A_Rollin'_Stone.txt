<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Papa_Was_A_Rollin'_Stone">
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
Never had a chance to see him, no
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said
Chorus
"Papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone" (repeat)
Hey, Mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life
Some bad talk going around sayin'
Papa had there outside children
And another wife
That ain't right
Heard some talk about Papa and his storefront
Preachin'
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time
Leaching
And dealing in dirt
Stealin' in the name of the Lord
But Mama she just said
Chorus
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades
Is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow or steal just
To pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin'
Spent most of his time chansin' women and drinkin'
But Mother, I'm depending on you to tell me the
Truth
But my mama she just said
Chorus(2x)
