<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="One_Wild_Night_2001">
It's a hot night, the natives are restless
We're sweating by the light of the moon
There's a voodoo mojo brewing at the go-go
That could knock a witch off her broom
We slither on in and shed our skin
Make our way into the bump and the grind
So I'm passing by, she gives me the eye
So I stop to give her a light
(One wild night)
Blinded by the moonlight
(One wild night)
Twenty-four hours of midnight
(One wild night)
I stepped into the twilight zone
And she left my heart with vertigo
One wild, one wild night
Havin' as much fun as you can in your clothes
Margarita had me feelin' alright
It just might be that I found religion
I've been on my knees for half of the night
I was rolling the bones with Jimmy no dice
Gonna take him for a couple weeks' pay
Man, if you lose this roll I take your girlfriend home, well, alright
(One wild night)
Blinded by the moonlight
(One wild night)
Twenty-four hours of midnight
(One wild night)
I stepped into the twilight zone
And she left my heart with vertigo
(One wild night)
Hey, c'est la vie
(One wild night)
Welcome to the party
(One wild night)
Life is for the living so
You gotta live it up, come on, let's go
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night
(One wild night)
Blinded by the moonlight
(One wild night)
Twenty-four hours of midnight
(One wild night)
I stepped into the twilight zone
And she left my heart with vertigo
(One wild night)
Hey, c'est la vie
(One wild night)
Welcome to the party
(One wild night)
Life is for the living so
You gotta live it up, come on, let's go
One wild night
One wild night
One wild night
One wild night
(One wild night)
Blinded by the moonlight
(One wild night)
Twenty-four hours of midnight
(One wild night)
I stepped into the twilight zone
And she left my heart with vertigo
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night
