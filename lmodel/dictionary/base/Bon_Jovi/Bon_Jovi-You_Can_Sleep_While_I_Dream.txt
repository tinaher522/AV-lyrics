<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="You_Can_Sleep_While_I_Dream">
You're boy sits down to write a song 'cause he thinks he's got something to say
Innocence thinks it can change the world but the world keeps getting in the way
It's a small list for the optimist who believes that he can fly
In a long line full of pessimists to stop him every time he tries
Some people see things as they are and ask,"why?"
I dream things that never were, I take my shot and say, "why not?"
(Hey, hey, hey) This one's for the dreamers
(Hey, hey, hey) Doubting disbelievers
Get out of my way
I bend but I aint' breaking
Scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream
Convicted by convictions, they were carving out your cross
They came to take your measurements just to show you who's the boss
Until I reach that promised land I won't stop
When I get there I'll shake your hand so meet me on that mountaintop
(Hey, hey, hey) This one's for the dreamers
(Hey, hey, hey) Doubting disbelievers
Get out of my way
I bend but I aint' breaking
Scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream
(Hey, hey, hey) This one's for the breathing
(Hey, hey, hey) Forgotten and the bleeding
I may whisper but I'm screaming
I got angels, I got demons
Baby, you can sleep while I dream
I'm not suggesting that you fly with me (Yeah, yeah)
Well here's a dose of some reality (Yeah, yeah)
You're swinging at a change-up, boy you better shape up, here comes the wrecking ball
Good morning, here's your wake-up call
(Hey, hey, hey) I feel the change a comin'
(Hey, hey, hey) See that train a comin'
(Hey, hey, hey) This one's for the dreamers
(Hey, hey, hey) Doubting disbelievers
Get out of my way
I bend but I ain't breaking
I'm scared but I ain't shaking
Baby, you can sleep while I dream
(Hey, hey, hey) This one's for the breathing
(Hey, hey, hey) The dying and the bleeding
Get out of my way
I may whisper but I'm screaming
I got angels, I got demons
Baby, you can sleep while I dream, when I dream… and I dream… I dream…
(Hey, hey, hey) I can feel the change a come
(Hey, hey, hey) I see that train a coming
Can you see it?
