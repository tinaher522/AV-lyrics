<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Blame_It_On_The_Love_Of_Rock_&_Roll">
Ooh yeah
C'mon
First time I heard the music
I thought it was my own
I could feel it in my heartbeat
I could feel it in my bones
My mama thinks I'm crazy
Dad says I'm insane
I got that boogie woogie fever
Burning in my veins
They took me to a doctor
But it's too late for me
They dragged me to a preacher
They saw on their TV
He said  «all for a small donation 
My lost soul would be saved »
I said I don't think so preacher
I'll come back another day
All that I want is to be a Rolling Stone
They don't understand what we all know
It feels so good, it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up, I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock &amp; roll
As the story goes
Listen up
Hey, my teachers didn't like me
They tried to put me down
'Cause I wore my hair too long
Played my music way too loud
Every little boy
Wants to learn to play guitar 
So he can pick up all the chicks
And be a rock &amp; roll star
They said it won't last, but they misunderstood
If people think it's bad, I'll be bad for good
Lord, you know It feels so good, it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock &amp; roll
Blame it on love
Blame it on the love 
Well, daddy just don't understand what the little girls know
Blame it on the love of rock &amp; roll
All I wanted (all that I wanted)
All I ever needed (all that I needed)
My guitar gave to me
Every song I've sung (blame it on love)
Every war I've won (blame it on love)
Everything I've done (blame it on the love)
Blame it on the love of rock &amp; roll 
Feels so good, it ought to be illegal 
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock &amp; roll
Blame it on love
B-b-blame it on the love
Daddy just don't get what his little girl loves
Blame it on the love of rock &amp; roll
