<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="The_Radio_Saved_My_Life_Tonight">
I got something on my mind 
I'm just a little bit depressed
I tried to blame it on the rain 
But it was in my heart I guess
I'm feeling like a stranger 
When I drove through my hometown
Passed the sign that reads 'The Boyhood Home of a Place That's Long Gone Now'
I realized ain't nothing what it used to be
Until I heard a song that takes me to my memories
The radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
Made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
Just this side of morning 
Just this side of dawn
I walked so soft into my bedroom 
Saw my wife sleeping alone
She whispered, "Baby, are you OK? Have you been gone for long?"
I just kicked off my jeans and I held her close 
I held her all night long
I tried to sleep but in my mind I heard that song
Like a friend in need the melody keeps me hanging on
The radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
Made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
The sad song that the DJ played made me feel alright
As I drove down that lonesome highway just me and my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
I made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
