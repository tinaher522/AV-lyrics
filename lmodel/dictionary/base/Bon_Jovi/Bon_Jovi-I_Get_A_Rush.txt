<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I_Get_A_Rush">
Every day of my life has been leading me here tonight
Feels like I'm coming home back to you, back to you
Every chance that I take
Every wrong turn and every mistake
Is a step on the road back to you
And I'm alive
I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah, I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know what I like, yeah, I get a rush
And my goal, I see you, you're as close as the hole in my shoe
And when I'm feeling used, I'm renewed, I get high
I can fly, I've got wings
I've got riches that money can't bring
I've got more than a king, I've got you
And baby, that's alright
I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah, I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know what I like, yeah, I get a rush
From you, everything you do
I call it love
Yeah, I get a rush, I get a rush
Every day of my life has been leading me here tonight
And wherever I roam I'm heading back home to you
Back to you
I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah, I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know what I like, yeah, I get a rush
I like it, I like it, I can't get enough
I like it, I like it, yeah, I get a rush
I like what I like and I like it too much
You know what I like, yeah, I get a rush
From you, everything you do
I call it love
