<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="We_Got_It_Going_On">
Is there anybody out there looking for a party? Yeah!
Shake your money maker, baby smoke it if you got it
We just wanna have some fun if you don't wanna kiss this
Everybody raise your hands; come on, I need a witness
We Got It Goin' On
We'll be banging and singing just like the Rolling Stones
We're gonna shake up your sole, we're gonna rattle your bones
'Cause We Got It Goin' On
Ah ha ha. Ah ha ha. Hey Yeah
You got a ticket to kick it, I wanna hear you scream now
'Cause tonight you got the right to let your hair down
Well, everybody's getting down; we're getting down to buissness
Insane, freak train, you don't wanna miss this
We Got It Goin' On
We'll be banging and singing just like the Rolling Stones
We're gonna shake up your sole, we're gonna rattle your bones
'Cause We Got It Goin' On
Ah ha ha. Ah ha ha. Hey Yeah
Ah ha ha. Ah ha ha. Hey Yeah
And now, a public service announcement from my country cousin
Big Kenny, talk to the people!
Brothers and sisters...(what?)
We're here to come together as one and Love Everybody!
Can I get an Amen?(Amen!)
We Got It Goin' On
We Got It Goin' On
We Got It Goin' On
We'll be banging and singing just like the Rolling Stones
We're gonna shake up your sole, we're gonna rattle your bones
'Cause We Got It Goin' On.
Gettin' down with Big and Rich, and Richie and Jon
Just banging and singing, why don't you all come along?
'Cause We Got It Goin' On.
Ah ha ha. Ah ha ha. Hey Yeah
Ah ha ha. Ah ha ha. Hey Yeah
We got it, we got it, we got it goin' on
We got it, we got it, we got it goin' on
