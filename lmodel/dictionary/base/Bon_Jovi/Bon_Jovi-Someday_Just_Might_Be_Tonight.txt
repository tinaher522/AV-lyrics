<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Someday_Just_Might_Be_Tonight">
Playing king of the mountain on a dead end street
At the end of the block is where we cut our teeth
The world was trying to sweep up off our feet
I'd run home crying with cut up knees
"Alright," Mama said. "It's alright."
Now nothing's and it never will
When you learn to swallow defeat like a bitter pill
Remember the story about Jack 'n' Jill
They ended up driving in a Coupe de Ville
You don't know when your ship will arrive
Don't give up, don't give in
Stand and fight, you just might win
When the ride gets rough
Hold on tight
Someday just might be tonight
You're the kind that goes swimming with a raincoat on
Who's to say if you are right or wrong
Let me know when you figured it out
Just don't go drowning in a shadow of doubt
Don't let the bastards make up your mind
Don't give up, don't give in
Stand and fight, you just might win
When the ride gets rough
Hold on tight
Someday just might be tonight
You may never find a treasure that's been washed up on the beach
Heaven won't be waiting for you walking down these city streets
Remember Mama's Band Aids on your scabby knees
They had to bleed for little victories
Don't give up, don't give in
Stand and fight, you just might win
When the ride gets rough
Hold on tight
Someday just might be tonight
Don't give up, don't give in
You never when the ship will come in
When the ride gets rough
Hold on tight
