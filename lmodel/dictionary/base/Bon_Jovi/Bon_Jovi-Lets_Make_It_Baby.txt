<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Lets_Make_It_Baby">
When I look in your eyes
I can feel the fire
I see through disguise
Can't conceal desire
I've been reading your lips
I don't need no translation
They want more than a kiss
I wanna give my donation
So turn out the lights
I'm going down slowly
Don't tell me what's right
Tell me you want me
Oh, tell me you want me
Don't tell me you love me
Tell me you want me
And let's make it, baby
And let's make it, baby
Let's make it, baby
Well, let's make it, baby
Come, come, come a little bit closer
I want to play doctor
Oh, it's getting hard, harder, harder to keep you away
I want to taste the sweat running off of your body
We'll get the sheets all wet
Baby, I'll make you feel naughty
Turn off the lights
I'm going down slowly
Don't tell me what's right
Just tell me you want me
Tell me you want me
Don't tell me you love me
Well, tell me you want me, want me, want me
Let's make it, baby
Let's make it, baby
And let's make it, baby
Let's make it, baby
Solo 
So turn out the lights
Baby, go down slowly
Don't you tell me you want me
Don't you tell me you love me, love me
Just tell me... you want
Tell me, tell me, you want... tell me
Let's make it, baby
Oh, let's make it, baby
Let's make it, baby
Well, let's make it, baby
