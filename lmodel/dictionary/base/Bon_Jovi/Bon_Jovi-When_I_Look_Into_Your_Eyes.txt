<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="When_I_Look_Into_Your_Eyes">
I see forever when I look in your eyes 
You're all I've ever wanted 
I always want you to be mine 
Let's make a promise to the end of time 
We'll always be together 
And our love will never die 
So here we are face to face and heart to heart 
I want you to know we will never be apart 
Now I believe that wishes can come true 
'Cause when I see my whole world 
I see only you 
When I look into your eyes 
I can see how much I love you 
And it makes me realize 
When I look into your eyes 
I see all my dreams come true 
When I look into your eyes 
I've looked for you all of my life 
Now that I've found you 
We will never say good-bye 
Can't stop this feelin' 
And there's nothing I can do 
'Cause I see everything 
When I look at you 
When I look into your eyes 
I can see how much I love you 
And it makes me realize 
When I look into your eyes 
I see all my dreams come true 
When I look into your eyes. 
When I look into your eyes 
I can see how much I love you 
And it makes me realize 
When I look into your eyes 
We will always be together 
And our love will never die 
When I look into your eyes 
I see all my dreams come true 
When I look into your eyes 
When I look into your eyes.
