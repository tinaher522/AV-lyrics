<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="She_Don't_Know_Me">
What more can I do, there's nothing I haven't tried 
Still it's so hard for her to notice 
I've tried hard to be straight 
There's nothing left I can say 
If only she would look my way 
(She don't know me) She don't know 
(She don't see me) She don't care 
(She can't hear me) Can't hear 
(Can not help me) She don't want 
(She don't want me) Like I want her 
(Like I want her) Got to tell her 
(Got to tell her) That I love her 
(That I love her)
She doesn't even know my name 
I dream of when she'll be mine 
I dream of crossing that line 
And holding her so tender 
Dreaming it could come true 
So many things I would do 
If only you'd give me a chance 
(She don't know me) She don't know 
(She don't see me) She don't care 
(She can't hear me) Can't hear 
(Can not help me) She don't want 
(She don't want me) Like I want her 
(Like I want her) Got to tell her 
(Got to tell her) That I love her 
(That I love her)
