"Once upon a time...
Not so long ago."
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike 
He's down on his luck, it's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man 
She brings home her pay for love
Mmm, for love
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot!
Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk so tough
Mmm, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, 
Tommy whispers, "Baby it's okay
Someday"
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot!
Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer!
Oh, we've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
