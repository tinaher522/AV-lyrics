<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I_Believe">
Yeah
All I know is what I've been sold
You can read my life like a fortune told
I've seen the dream, there ain't no land of Oz
But I got my brain and I got a heart
And courage built, I won't let go
What we need right now is soul
I can't do this, you can't do that
They feed us lines but I won't act
And all good things will come to pass
But the truth is all you have to have
And would you lie for it?
Cry for it?
Die for it?
Would you? 
I believe, I believe
With every breath that I breathe
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream
I believe, I believe
You gave it all, then you gave more
You know what you came here for
You pay the cost, like it's your cross to bear
Are we the ones who put it there?
And would you scheme for it?
Scream for it?
Bleed for it?
Would you?
I believe, I believe
Believe we're still worth the fight
You'll see, there's hope for this world tonight
I believe, I believe, yeah
Don't look up to your movie screens
Your records or your magazines
Close your eyes and you will see
That you are all you really need
I believe, I believe
With every breath that I breathe
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
Three, four
I believe
Whoa (whoa)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
I believe
I believe
I believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah
