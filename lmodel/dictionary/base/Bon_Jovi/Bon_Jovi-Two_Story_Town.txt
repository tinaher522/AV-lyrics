<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Two_Story_Town">
I couldn't sleep 
Took a walk down Second Avenue 
Sick of dreaming dreams that never come true 
One way street and I know where its leading to 
There's a "For Sale" sign on the front door of the city hall 
The subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall 
I could take a hit but I don't want to take the fall 
That's just one side of the story 
In this two story town 
It's just the same old sights 
And the same old sounds 
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town 
It's the same old ship going down 
I'm going down, down ,down, down, down 
It's a two story town 
There's a girl that I sleep with 
She's got ecstasy eyes 
He promised her roses and American pie 
I called her and my demons 
And I kissed them both goodbye 
Seven days of Monday morning 
In a two story town 
It's just the same old sights 
And the same old sounds 
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round 
It's the same old ship going down 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
It's a two story town 
One shot to make a move now 
The ghosts are calling me out 
And me I'm just one story 
In a two story town 
But you're never going to find me in the lost and found 
It's just the same old sights 
And the same old sounds 
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round 
It's the same old ship going down 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
It's a two story town 
It's just the same old sights and the same old sounds 
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round 
I won't give in and I won't back down 
I'm going down, down, down, down down 
I'm never going down, down, down, down, down
I ain't going down, down, down, down, down 
It's a two-story town
