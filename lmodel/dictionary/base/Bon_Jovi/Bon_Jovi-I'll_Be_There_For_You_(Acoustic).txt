<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I'll_Be_There_For_You_(Acoustic)">
If I close my eyes forever
I know you'll be always there
Baby we will stay together
And this branded love we'll share
Even though you're not around me
Babe I know you're not apart
From a distance I am calling
And I'm sending you my heart
Baby all I gotta do now
Is to pray to please hold on
I'm saving all my love for you
'Til you'll be coming home
I'll be there for you
To brighten up your eyes
I'll be there for you
To make you realize
When I look into the future
Baby, all I see is you
I'll be there for you
That's all I wanna do
Yes, we've been through, good and bad times
And we know we had it all
There were storms we had to weather
We've been down this road before
As the world just keeps on turning
As the bird that flies so high
As the fire keeps on burning
Our love will never die
And baby you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine
I'll be there for you
To brighten up your eyes
I'll be there for you
To make you realize
Oh, yeah, when I look into the future
Baby, all I see is you
I'll be there for you
That's all I wanna do
(Ooh) I wasn't there when you were happy
I wasn't there when you were down
Didn't mean to miss your birthday
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out, yeah, yeah
I'll be there for you
To brighten up your eyes
I'll be there for you
To make you realize
Mmm, yeah, when I look into the future
Baby, all I see is you
I'll be there for you
That's all I wanna do
Yes, I look into the future
Baby, all I see is you
I'll be there for you
That's all I want, I wanna do
