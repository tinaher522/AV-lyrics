<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Too_Much_Of_A_Good_Thing">
Love is like quicksand
It's always bringing me down
But I still keep coming back for more
And like an addiction
One is never enough
I'm like a junkie at your door
Too much of a good thing is like getting high and coming down
My heart's on a string
I've been blind to the sting
Getting much too much of a good thing
I came to your party
And stayed a little to late
You woke up naked on the floor
You are my strongest weakness
And I don't want nothing else
You got the fix I'm looking for
Too much of a good thing will turn your whole world upside down
My heart's on a string
I've been blind to the sting
Getting much too much of a good thing
She's my favorite disease
Makes me crawl on my knees
Getting much too much of a good thing
Like you partied all night and you're too trashed from drinking
The only way out is another shot glass to sink in
Tell me, baby, what'll it take
I keep making the same mistakes
My heart's on a string
I was blind to the sting
Getting much too much of a good thing
And I know it's no good
Yeah, I'd quit if I could
Getting much too much
Getting much too much
