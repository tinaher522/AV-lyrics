<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Shut_Up_And_Kiss_Me">
I don't wanna talk about it
Baby wanna talk all night
You're on your feet six days a week
We're working nights just trying to make ends meet
We break our backs on the killing floor
Another guy's what's we're doing it for
We got a lot, we don't need more
We're rolling, baby; tell me when you go
Rolling, ready; tell me where to go
I don't wanna watch the TV
Wash the dishes now or pay the bills
Don't wanna eat, don't need to sleep
The only real meal that gives me a thrill
Don't need no candles, you're the spark
Don't need no matches, just a fire in the dark
We come together and that's a good start
Baby, crazy, and I know that you can't hide
'Cause the earth anywhere, there up on the other side
We break our backs on the killing floor
Another guy's what's we're doing it for
We got a lot, we don't need more
We're rolling, baby; tell me when you go
Rolling, ready; tell me where to go
Baby, crazy, and I know that you can't hide
'Cause the earth anywhere, there up on the other side.
