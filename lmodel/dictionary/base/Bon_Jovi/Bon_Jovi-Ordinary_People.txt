<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Ordinary_People">
Little Jimmy just bought high-top sneakers
He wants to fly high like his heroes can
He's got a smile like Michael Jordan
In the school yard, Jimmy, he's the man
I'm sitting here watching his heart beating
He's ten feet tall, all five foot four of him
Come six o'clock working out his foul shots
The ball ain't falling, Momma's calling
She smiles and says
You and me, we're ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
But these are extraordinary times
She lives alone, got four kids through high school
She cleans houses and takes in wash at night
You'd never know what she don't have much
Because she's rich with the things money can't buy
She don't need clothes
She don't want diamonds
Don't got a brand new car to drive in
What she got is love and that's a lot
At least it's a good start
You and me, we're ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
But these are extraordinary times
Everybody wants to be somebody
Everybody wants to be someone
We only want to watch the game on Sunday
Sit back and catch a little buzz
Ain't nobody wants to be nobody
Everybody wants a little love
Everybody wants to be the hero
Ride into the setting sun
You and me, we're ordinary people
Living in our ordinary lives
We can be ordinary people
But these are extraordinary times
I got dreams like ordinary people
I can see it when I close my eyes at night
Can't you see we're ordinary people
