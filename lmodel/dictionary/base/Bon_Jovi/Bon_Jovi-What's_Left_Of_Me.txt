<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="What's_Left_Of_Me">
For thirty hard years I was a newspaperman
I made my living with a pen and a pad
God I miss the smell of paper and the ink on my hands
Been back from the desert for a year or so
Left more in the sand then you'll ever know
Another war's waiting for me when I got back home
In the name of the flags one gave their lives
I'm still living yeah Semper Fi
Well that's my story, what else can I say, hey hey
I got a lot to give so can't you see
I'm still breathing an my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me
Boarding up the house they left the keys
For growing on my city rolled up these streets
I ain't checking out I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me, hey hey
They called us dirty Harry, we're a punk rock band
When it's sold off CBGB's I don't understand
All that's left now are the t-shirts and the comp' for a good plan
I sold my drums to make ends meet
The band broke up, we had to eat
It's the same old shit, it happens more these days,
Hey hey
I got a lot to give so can't you see
I'm still breathing an my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me
Boarding up the house they left the keys
For growing on my city rolled up these streets
I ain't checking out I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me, hey hey
Well I'm a teacher, I'm a farmer, I'm a union man
It's getting harder to make a living on this hard land
We ain't working in our factories all these jobs went overseas
Does anybody want, does anybody want
Does anybody want what's left of me
I got a lot to give so can't you see
I'm still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me
Does anybody want to buy or rent
Take the chance or place a bet
I ain't checking out I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me Hey Hey
Does anybody want, does anybody want
Does anybody want what's left of me Hey Hey
Does anybody want, does anybody want
Does anybody want what's left of me.
