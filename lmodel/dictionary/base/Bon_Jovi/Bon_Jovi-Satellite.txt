<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Satellite">
Are you out there?
Can you hear me?
Do you know my whereabouts?
Do you know what I'm all about?
Through the static you're so close, so far away
Are you listening?
I'm desperate.
Sendin' out an S.O.S.
'Cause I'm lost I must confess
Throw a lifeline
I'm down here drownin'
In the deepest part of me
Satellite
Can you feel me?
Satellite
Come and heal me
Are you watchin' over me tonight?
I need to know you're out there
Satellite
Are your lines open and receiving?
You know I got so much to say
I just don't want to fade away
Keep on talkin' 'cause you're keeping' me alive
Satellite
Can you feel me?
Satellite
Come and heal me
Are you watchin' over me tonight
I need to know y9ou're out there
Satellite
Everybody hurts
Everybody cries
Everybody needs someone
To save them sometimes
Everybody hurts
Everybody cries
Everybody needs someone
To save them sometimes
Satellite
Can you feel me?
Satellite
Come and heal me
Are you watchin' over me tonight
I need to know you're out there
