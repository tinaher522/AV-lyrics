TRAVELIN' BAND 
(J.C. Fogerty)
737 comin' out of the sky.
Oh! Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride,
I wanna move.
Playin' in a Travelin' Band. Yeah!
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand,
Playin' in a Travelin' Band.
Take me to the hotel, Baggage gone, oh, well.
Come on, come on, won't you get me to my room,
I wanna move.
Listen to the radio, Talkin' 'bout the last show.
Someone got excited, Had to call the State Militia,
Wanna move.
Oh! WOW!
Here we come again on a Saturday night
Oh with your fussin' and a fightin'
Won't you get me to the rhyme,
I wanna move.
Oh! WOW!
Oh! I'm playin' in a Travelin' Band
Playin' in a Travelin' Band.
Won't you get me, take me hand
Well, I'm playin' in a Travelin' Band,
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land.
Tryin' to get a hand,
Playin' in a Travelin' Band, OH! WOW!
Hey!
