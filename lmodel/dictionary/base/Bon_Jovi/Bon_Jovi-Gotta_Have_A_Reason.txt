<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Gotta_Have_A_Reason">
Here we stand, caught between the cradle and the grave
In a world that gives you nothing but your name
With every step you take you must be brave
Nothing lost is nothing gained
And I know lives are lost for crowns and kings
We all know love is lost for lesser things
And the angels here have broken wings
Though I know somewhere a choir sings
You gotta have a reason
A reason to believe
A reason just to dream
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
A reason to believe
A hot-headed hero, here you see I'm just a man
Comes a time, a time to make a stand
So here I am with heart in hand
Don't be afraid to understand
You gotta have a reason
One reason to believe
A reason just to dream
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
A reason to believe in trust,
I believe in faith
I believe in us
'Til my dying day
You gotta have a reason
You gotta have a reason
If all we've got is you and me
Then what we've got is all we need
You gotta have as reason
One reason to believe
A reason just to dream
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
One reason
You gotta have a reason
One reason to believe
A reason just to dream
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
One reason
Gotta have a reason
Gotta have a reason
One reason to believe
