Billy works too hard, trying to make ends meet
He's gotta pay his credit cards, yeah he's been dealing with the odds that even
Vegas can't beat
By six he's out of bed, she makes his coffee sweet
He grabs his boots &amp; his coat, leaves a note that says I Love You
And runs to catch a bus down at the end of Market Street
It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down, but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at home, feels like it's Christmas Eve
Gracie's got his dinner on the stove, Daddy's coming home
And they've got seven hungry children that are tugging on his sleeve
It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down, but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He arrives at 9 as the work bell's ringing
Hits the grind but his heart is singing
Some men live for money
Some men live for work
But it's a real man, a richer man who knows what love's worth
It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down, but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
A rich man living in a poor man's house
A rich man living in a poor man's house
A rich man living in a poor man's house
