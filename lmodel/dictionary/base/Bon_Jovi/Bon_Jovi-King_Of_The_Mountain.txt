<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="King_Of_The_Mountain">
Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out 
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls 
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout 
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control 
I been down and mistreated 
Now we're standing undefeated 
I'm the king of the mountain 
I'm the king of the hill 
I'm the king of the mountain 
I'm the king of the hill 
You spend your life working 9 to 5 it's like doing time 
Boss man says "Hey boy, you'll never be no good" 
With the night there's a magic in the air that makes us come alive 
Tonight's the night they can't put you down, no one could 
I been down and mistreated 
Now we're standing undefeated 
I'm the king of the mountain 
I'm the king of the hill 
I'm the king of the mountain 
I'm the king of the hill 
Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out. 
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls. 
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout 
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control 
I been down and mistreated 
We won't be cheated 
Now we're standing undefeated... 
I'm the king of the mountain 
I'm the king of the hill 
I'm the king of the mountain 
I'm the king of the hill
