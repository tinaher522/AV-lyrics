<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Maybe_Someday">
And I would give up tomorrow
And die for one yesterday
I'd lie, beg, steal and borrow
To hear you whisper my name
Tonight there ain't no miracles
Washing up on this beach
The angels left here long ago
But I still believe that
Maybe someday
I will hold your hand
and maybe someway
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand
And just walk away… baby someday
Now I don't know how a heart beats
But I sure know how one breaks
Remember how I used to hold you
To share every breath that you'd take
How can I forget
Your every tear that I cry
I know you're coming back
You never kissed me goodbye
Maybe someday
I will hold your hand
And maybe someway
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand
And just walk away…
They say that nothing lasts forever
But we know our two hearts beat together
And though you're far away
Every night I pray
Maybe someday… someday…
Maybe someday
I will understand
baby someway
We'll trace these footsteps in the sand
just walk away… maybe someday
Maybe someday
Maybe someday
Maybe someway
