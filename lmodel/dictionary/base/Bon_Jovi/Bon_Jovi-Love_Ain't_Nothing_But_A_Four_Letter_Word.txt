<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Love_Ain't_Nothing_But_A_Four_Letter_Word">
She was waiting alone at the station
Praying for her train to arrive
Thinking 'bout her destination,
Her tattered bag held all that she had in life
She turned her back on her family
She said goodbye to her friends
She turned her back on a married man
When she took off that wedding band
But through her crying she said I don't need this
Through the tears she said it's all a waste
It ain't nothing like it is in the movies
Here a hit is just a slap in the face
And it's no big secret so forget all you heard
'Cause love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
For some it's for better, for us it's for worse
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Nothing
This time he said was the last time
Last time he said just the same
In your heart you know that they'll be a next time
That your battered bones would have to explain
Now your bruises can't ride on religion
Since you swore it was for better or worse
But how many times must you lay down and say
It's something that I deserved
It ain't no big secret so forget all you heard
'Cause love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
For some it's a blessing, for some it's a curse
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Forget about your rosary beads
To take you through your time of need
You'll pray to God to cross that line
And take it one day at a time
Still you try and make some sense of
All the things that he had said
Was there something so wrong to turn eyes so blue
To fiery eyes of red again?
And it's no big secret so forget all you heard
'Cause love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
For some it's for better, for us it's for worse
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Nothing
There's no big secret so forget all you heard
Cause love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
For some it's a blessing, for some it's a curse
But love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word
