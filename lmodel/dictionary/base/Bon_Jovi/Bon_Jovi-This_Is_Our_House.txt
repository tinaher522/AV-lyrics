<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="This_Is_Our_House">
This is our time
This is our night
Are you alive?
Get up, get up, get up, get up, time to fly
Are we gonna raise the roof? (Oh yeah)
Are we gonna touch the sky? (Hell yeah)
Everybody with me let me hear you now
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
This is our house
These are my people, mister, this is my town
This is our house
Ain't nobody know we're gonna knock it down
(Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh)
This is our house
(Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh)
With the wind at our side
We have arrived
We won't be denied
Get up, get up, get up, get up, time to shine
Are we gonna turn it up? (Oh yeah)
Are we gonna shake it up? (Hell yeah)
Let me see you raise 'em up and shout out loud
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
This is our house
These are my people, mister, this is my town
This is our house
Ain't nobody know we're gonna knock it down
This is our house
These are my colours, this is sacred ground
This is our house
Ain't nobody know we're gonna knock it down
This is our house
(Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh)
This is our house
(Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh)
This is our house
Ain't nobody know we're gonna knock it down
