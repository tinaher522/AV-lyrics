<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I_Don't_Like_Mondays">
The silicon chip inside her head, 
Got switched to overload 
Nobody's gonna go to school today, 
She's gonna make them stay at home, 
And Daddy doesn't understand it, 
He always said she was good as gold, 
And he can see (no reasons) 
'Cause there are (no reasons) 
What reason do you need to be shown 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
I want to shoot the whole day down 
The telex machine is kept so clean 
And it types to a waiting world, 
Her Mother feels so shocked 
Father's world is rocked 
And their thoughts turn to 
Their own little girl 
Well sweet 16 ain't she peachy keen, 
And it ain't so neat to admit defeat, 
There could be (no reasons) 
Because there are (no reasons) 
What reasons do you need, oh, 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
I'm gonna shoot the whole day down, down, down 
I'll shoot it all down 
And all the playing's stopped in the playground now 
She wants to play with her toys a while 
And school is out, oh and soon we will learn that 
the lesson today is how to die 
And then the bullhorn crackles, 
And the captain tackles 
with the problems and the how's and why's 
and he can see (no reasons) 
'Cause there are (no reasons) 
What reasons do you need to die, die, oh 
And the silicon chip inside her head 
gets switched to overload, oh 
and nobody's gonna go to school today 
She's gonna make them stay at home 
And Daddy doesn't understand it 
He always said she was good as gold 
And he could see (no reasons) 
'Cause there are (no reasons) 
What reason do you need to be shown 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like, I don't like 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like, I don't like 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays 
I want to shoot the whole day down
