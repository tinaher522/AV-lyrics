They should have put her in the movies
My little country cutie
She's the reason I believe God made blue jeans
I was a slicker from the city
When I met that little filly 
I was six foot tall till she brought me to my knees
I sold my father's car for a pickup truck
I never drink champagne
I was Jack, straight up
Well, you better like Hank here 
Or you're outta luck
What's up!
She put the boy back in cowboy
And I was just a redneck wannabe
She put the boy back in cowboy
That southern woman made a new man outta me
The transformation was amazing
Even Jesus couldn't save me 
Late at night, I was such a sight to see
At the rodeo she kissed me
Then said, "Boy don't get too frisky
If you're lucky, you might two-step home with me"
Yeah, I got the boots
I bought the Stetson hat
I got a big belt buckle tryin' to rope a calf
I made a ring of fire and as cool as Johnny Cash
She put the boy back in cowboy
And I was just a redneck wannabe
She put the boy back in cowboy
That southern woman made a new man outta me
That country woman made a new man outta me
She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in cowboy
She's a livewire, bonfire, desire
She got me high, high, high, high, high
She put the boy back in cowboy
And I was just a redneck wannabe
She put the boy back in cowboy
That country woman
She put the boy back in cowboy
And I was just a redneck wannabe
She put the boy back in cowboy
Showed me not to fake your company 
That southern woman made a new man outta me
She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in cowboy
She put the boy back in ...
