<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Last_Night">
These days, it's hard to have a heart
It doesn't matter where you come from
Or who you think you are
These days, it's hard, just fitting in
Why does someone have to lose
For someone else to win?
We're all looking for forgiveness
And someone we can trust
You can wrap your arms around the world
It all comes down to us
This is the last night
You'll have to be alone
I'll be standing right beside you
If you can't make it on your own
So walk with me, please
Help me to be strong
I'll be the shoulder you can lean on
When everybody's gone
This is the last night
You'll have to be alone
I know you've heard it all before
There's nothing worse than living less
When you yearn for something more
Makes no sense, it's hard to understand
When there's something that should fill you up
Keeps slipping through your hands
This is the last night
You'll have to be alone
I'll be standing right beside you
If you can't make it on your own
So walk with me, please
Help me to be strong
I'll be the shoulder you can lean on
When everybody's gone
This is the last night
You'll have to be alone
We're all looking for answers
We're all down here on our knees
All anybody really wants
Is something to believe
Enough is enough, I can't take any more
But I'm standing on your front porch
And kicking down your door
This is the last night
This is the last night
You'll have to be alone
I'll be standing right beside you
If you can't make it on your own
So walk with me, please
Help me to be strong
I'll be the shoulder you can lean on
Now here's where you belong
This is the last night
You'll have to be alone
This is the last night alone
This is the last night alone
This is the last night
You'll have to be alone
