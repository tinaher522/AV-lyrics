<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I_Want_To_Be_Loved">
I had a roof overhead
Had shoes on my feet
Yeah, sure I was fed
But no one was there when I was in need, yeah
So who am I now?
Who do you want me to be?
I can forgive you but I won't re-live you
I ain't the same scared kid I used to be
I'm gonna live
I'm gonna survive
I don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream
I ain't gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved
I found a picture
Our so-called family tree, yeah
I broke all the branches lookin' for answers
Don't you know that ain't how it's supposed to be?
I'm gonna live
I'm gonna survive
I don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream
I ain't gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie
I wanna give
I'm ready to try
Willing to lay it on the line
I wanna be loved
I wanna be...
I ain't gonna cry; I don't wanna scream
But I got so much left unsaid inside of me
I'm gonna live
I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream
I ain't gonna die 
Thinking my life was just a lie
I wanna give
I'm ready to try
Willing to lay it on the line
I wanna beloved
I wanna be loved
I just wanna be love
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved
