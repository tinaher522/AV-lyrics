<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Livin_In_Sin">
I don't need no license
To sign on no line
And I don't need no preacher
To tell me you're mine
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no new bride
I just need you, baby
To look me in the eyes
I know they have a hard time
And your daddy don't approve
But I don't need your daddy
Telling us what we should do
Now there's a million questions
I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer
To get me through the night
So I say, baby, can you tell me just where we fit in?
I call it love they call it livin' in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in?
I say we're livin' on love they say we're livin' in sin
Is it right for both our parents
Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights?
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone?
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight?
They say the promise is forever
If you sign it on the dotted line
Baby, can you tell me just where we fit in?
I call it love they call it livin' in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in?
I say we're living on love they say we're livin' in sin
Baby, can you tell me just where we fit in?
I call it love they call it livin' in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in?
We're living on love or are we livin' in sin?
I don't know just where we fit
Sometimes it scares me
I don't know where to begin
I don't know where we fit in
Livin' in sin
