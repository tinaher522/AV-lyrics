<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Open_All_Night">
I saw you coming from a mile away
Trying I hide another pretty face
Bet my last dollar baby you been bruised
Poor little heart all black 'n' blue
Last thing you need's another pickup line
You must have heard 'em all a thousand times
God only knows what you been through
Believe me I've been broken too
It aches, it breaks, it takes your breath away
I've been around that block a time or two, baby
I don't want to fall in love with you
I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth
Please don't say my name, give this heart a break
I don't want to make the same mistakes, it's too late
I'll leave on the light
These arms are open all night
I got your taste in the back of my mouth
I want to reach in and pull it out
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
When you're this close I'm afraid
The way I feel if I touch your hair
The way I miss you when you're not there
And then I see you when I close my eyes
It's too late, I've crossed that line
And it aches, it breaks, it takes your breath away
But I'll still be around come closing time
I don't want to fall in love with you
I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth
Please don't say my name, give this heart a break
I don't want to make the same mistakes but it's too late
I'll leave on the light
These arms are open all night
It's 2 a.m., it's last call baby
The barkeeper's gone, I'll walk you're home now
Save me, baby!
I don't want to fall in love with you
I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth
Please don't make me beg, give this heart a break
Please don't make me make the same mistakes, but it's too late
I'll leave on the light
These arms are open all night
