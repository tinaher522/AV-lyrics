<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="It's_My_Live">
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
This is for the ones who stood their ground
It's for Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck, it ain't enough, you've got to make your own breaks
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
