<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I_Want_You">
The last time that I saw her
Was the night she said goodbye
She said that love's a stranger
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did
As she packed up her belongings
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye
Well, I could see a tear roll off her face
As we both tried so hard not to cry
She said 
I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
'Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you
I tried so hard to remember
Where, when, how, why love went away
I tried to drown myself in pity
But your memory kept calling my name
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings, baby
All the things that my money brings
And the servants to paint the skies blue
And I worked so hard seven days a week
Built a fortress for your heart to keep
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you
I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
'Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you
I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
But never thought you were alone 
I filled the party up with company 
But never made our house a home 
All I've got is my guitar
These chords, and the truth
All I got is my guitar
But all I want, baby all I want
I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
'Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you
I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
