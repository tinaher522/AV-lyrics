<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Distance">
There's a train out in the distance
Destination still unknown
Far away where no one's waiting
So far from home, so far from home
There's a rose outside your window
The first snow is fallin' down
Like that lonesome whistle blowin'
I keep on goin', keep on goin'
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking
Through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress
And your arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance
There's a thread that runs between us
Pullin' across this great divide
It's only there for the believers
Don't stop believin', don't stop believin'
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking
Through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress
When your arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance, I'll go the distance
There's a never endin' story
That begins with you and I
Like a rose outside your window
Don't let it die, don't let it die
Don't let it die
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking
Through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress
And your arms are reaching through the night
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking
Through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress
And my arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance, I'll go the distance
I'll go the distance, I'll go the distance
I'll go the distance
