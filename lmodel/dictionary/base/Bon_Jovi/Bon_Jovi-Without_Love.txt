<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Without_Love">
She wasn't young, but still a child 
There still was innocence 
In painted smiles 
She called to me as I passed her by 
Lady of the night looked in my eyes 
She said: I been through some changes 
But one thing always stays the same 
Without love, there's nothing without love 
Nothing else can get you through the night 
Nothing else feels right without love 
I saw a man down on lonely street 
A broken man who looked like me 
And no one knows the pain that he's been living 
He lost his love and still hasn't forgiven 
He said: I've been through some changes 
But one thing always stays the same 
Without love, there's nothing without love 
Nothing else can get you through the night 
Nothing else feels right without love 
There's nothing without love 
Nothing else but love can burn as bright 
And nothing would mean nothing without love 
I see my life 
Some things I took for granted 
Love's passed me by 
So many second chances 
I was afraid 
I won't be afraid no more 
Without love, there's nothing without love 
Nothing else can get you through the night 
Nothing else feels right without love 
There's nothing without love 
Nothing else but love can burn as bright 
And nothing would mean nothing without love
There's nothing without love 
Nothing without love
