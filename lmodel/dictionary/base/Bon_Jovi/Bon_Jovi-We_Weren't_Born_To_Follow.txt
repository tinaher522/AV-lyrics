<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="We_Weren't_Born_To_Follow">
This one goes out to the man who mines for miracles
This one goes out to the ones in need
This one goes out to the sinner and the cynical
This ain't about no apology
This road was paved by the hopeless and the hungry
This road was paved by the winds of change
Walking beside the guilty and the innocent
How will you raise your hand when they call your name?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that your saints and sinners bleed
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
This ones about anyone who does it differently
This ones about the one who curses and spits
This ain't about our living in a fantasy
This ain't about giving up or giving in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that your saints and sinners bleed
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
Guitar!
We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that your saints and sinners bleed
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
