<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Everybody's_Broken">
Welcome to the party
Come on in and disappear
You're feeling like a stranger 
But all your friends are here 
Little lines and cracks
Around your eyes and mouth
Something's trying to get in'
Something's trying to get out
It's okay to be a little broken
Everybody's broken in this life
It's okay to feel a little broken 
Everybody's broken, you're alright (alright)
it's just life
Step into the deep end
Make yourself at home
When you wonder why you're breathing
Know you're not alone
It's so hard to believe
What's easier to doubt
You're trying to hold in
What you're dying to scream out
It's okay to be a little broken
Everybody's broken in this life
It's okay to feel a little broken 
Everybody's broken
You're alright, it's alright
Its just life.
Take a look around
Tell me what you see
It's who you think you are
Who you wanna be
It's okay to be a little broken
Everybody's broken in this life
It's okay to feel a little broken 
Everybody's broken you're alright
Keep on going
Eyes wide open
Everybody's broken,
Everybody's broken,
Everybody's broken,
Everybody's broken,
Everybody's broken,
Everybody's broken,
Yeah yeah
