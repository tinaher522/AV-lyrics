<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="All_About_Lovin'you">
Looking at the pages of my life
Faded memories of me and you
Mistakes, you know, I've made a few
I took some shots and fell from time to time
Baby, you were there to pull me through
We've been around the block a time or two
I'm gonna lay it on the line
Ask me how we've come this far
The answer's written in my eyes
Every time I look at you
Baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before
And makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight
Dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
I've lived, I've loved, I've lost, I've paid some dues
And baby, we've been to hell and back again
Through it all you're always my best friend
For all the words I didn't say
And all the things I didn't do
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way
Every time I look at you
Baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before
And makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight
Dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
You can take this world away
You're everything I am
Just read the lines upon my face
I'm all about lovin' you
I'm all about, I'm all about
I'm all about lovin' you
Every time I look at you
Baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before
And makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight
Dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
I'm all about lovin' you
