<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="U_Give_Love_A_Bad_Name">
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Baby you give love a bad name
You've got it
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, you put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Whoa, you're a loaded gun
Whoa, there's nowhere to run
'Cause no one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love
You paint that smile on your lips
With blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Whoa, you're a loaded gun
Whoa, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You, you give love
Come on now, shot through the heart and you're to blame, sing it
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
One more time, shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
