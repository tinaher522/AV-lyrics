<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="I'll_Sleep_When_I'm_Dead">
Seven days of Saturday
Is all that I need 
Got no use for Sunday
'Cause I don't rest in peace 
I don't need no Monday
Or the rest of the week 
I spend a lot of time in bed
But baby, I don't like to sleep, no 
I won't lie to you
I'm never gonna cry to you
I'll probably drive you wild
Eight days a week 
Until I'm six feet under
Baby, I don't need a bed
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Till they roll me over
And lay my bones to rest
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead, hey
Alright, listen up
So you're looking for some action
I got got everything you need
Better keep your motor running
'Cause I was built for speed
This ain't no slumber party
Got no time for catching zzz's
If they say that that ain't healthy
Well, then living's a disease
We're never going to die, baby
Well, come on let me drive you crazy
We'll make every night another New Year's Eve
Till I'm six feet under
Baby, I don't need a bed
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Till they roll me over
And lay my bones to rest
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Seven days of Saturday
Is all that I need
Got no use for Sunday
'Cause I don't rest in peace
I was born to live
You know I wasn't born to die
But if they party down in Heaven
I'll be sure to be on time
Until I'm six feet under
Baby, I don't need a bed
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Till they roll me over
And lay my bones to rest
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I feel like I'm exploding
Going out of my head
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Til I'm six feet under
And they lay my bones to rest
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead
Gonna live while I'm alive
Sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Uh, uh, I'll sleep when I'm dead
(Sleep when I'm)
(Sleep when I'm)
(Sleep when I'm)
(Sleep when I'm dead)
(Sleep when I'm)
(Sleep when I'm)
(Sleep when I'm)
(Sleep when I'm dead)
