<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Captain_Crash">
You dressed up for a big date
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face
She was one of a kind
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella
And roller skates in bed
You ride the greyhound from his hometown
When he comes around 'cause they don't let him drive now
Mixed up as a milkshake but make no mistake
Crash just looking like the stars
You and me, we're invincible together
We can be so tragical, whatever
Dressed up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty Queen from Mars
Share a toothpick, trading lipstick
Watching traffic for days at the diner
Holding hands, making big plans
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm
You and me, we're invincible together
We can be, oh so tragical, whatever
All dressed up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty Queen from Mars
They're drunk on love as you can get
Getting high on lust and cigarettes
Living life with no regrets
At least they're gonna try to fly
You and me, we're invincible together
We can be so tragical, whatever
We're Sid and Nancy, Fred and Ginger
Clyde and Bonnie, Liz and Richard
Kurt and Courtney, Bacall and Bogie
Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe
Here's Captain Crash and the beauty Queen from Mars
And that's you and me
Captain Crash and the beauty Queen from Mars
