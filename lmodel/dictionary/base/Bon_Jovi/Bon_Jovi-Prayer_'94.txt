"Once upon a time
Not so long ago"
Tommy used to work on the docks
The union went on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
For love
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Oh, we're halfway there
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
Tommy threw his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk so tough
So tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries every night
Tommy whispers, "Baby it's okay
Someday"
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Oh, we're halfway there
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
We're livin' on a prayer
We've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
Oh, we're halfway there
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
Oh, we're halfway there
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
(Ohh, livin' on a prayer)
