<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Work_For_The_Working_Man">
I'm here trying to make a living
I ain't living just to die
Never getting back what I'm giving
Can someone somewhere help me justify
Why these strong hands are on the unemployment line
And theres nothing left, whats on my mind
Whoooaa oooh
Whos gonna work for the working man (work)
Hurt for the working man (work)
Get the hands in the dirt, whos gonna work of the curse (work)
Brother Ive been damned (work), if I dont raise a hand (work)
Work for the work, work, work for the working man (work)
Working man
Empty pockets full of worries
I had to get two jobs and it was hard enough just getting by
But with the grace of God I'll get us through
But only know that I know how to do
That Im the only one whos gotta look my family in the eye
Day after day, night after night
Whoaaaaa oooh
Whos gonna work for the working man (work)
Hurt for the working man (work)
Get the hands in the dirt, whos gonna work of the curse (work)
Brother I'll be damned (work), if I dont raise a hand (work)
Work for the work, work, work for the working man (work)
Working man, Working man, Working man
I lost my pension
They took my ID
These were my friends these were my dreams
These were my hopes, these are my streets
Can you hear me?
Whos gonna work for the working man (work)
Work for the working man (work)
Get the hands in the dirt, whos gonna work of the curse (work)
Brother I've been damned (work), if I dont raise a hand (work)
Who's gonna for the work, work, work for the working man (work)
Working man, working man, working man
These were my friends, these were my dreams
These were my hopes, these are my streets
