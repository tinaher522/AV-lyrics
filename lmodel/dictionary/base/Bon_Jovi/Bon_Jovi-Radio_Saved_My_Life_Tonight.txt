<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Radio_Saved_My_Life_Tonight">
I got something on my mind
I'm just a little bit depressed
I tried to blame it on the rain
But it was in my heart, I guess
I was feeling like a stranger
As I drove through my hometown
Past the sign that reads the boyhood home
Of a place that's long gone now
I realize ain't nothing what it used to be
Till I heard a song that takes me to my memories
The radio saved my life tonight
Old song that the DJ played made me feel all right
I made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
It was just this side of morning
Just this side of dawn
I walked so soft into my bedroom
Saw my wife sleeping alone
She whispered "baby are you okay? have you been gone for long?"
I just kicked off my jeans and I held her close
I held her all night long
I tried to sleep
But in my mind I heard that song
Like a friend in need
The melody keeps me hanging on
The radio saved my life tonight
That old that the DJ played made me feel all right
I made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio--saved my life tonight
That sad song that the DJ played made me feel all right
As I drove down that lonesome highway, just me and my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
Old song that the DJ played made me feel all right
Made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
The radio saved my life tonight
