<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Happy_Now">
What would you say to me
If I told you I had a dream
If I told you everything
Would you tell me to go back to sleep
Take a look in these tired eyes
They're coming back to life
I know I can change, got hope in my veins
I'm telling you I ain't going back to the pain
Can I be happy now?
Can I let my breath out
Let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just wanna scream out loud
Can I be happy now?
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turning my world around
Can I be happy now
Can I break free somehow
I just wanna live again
Love again
Pick my pride up off of the ground
I'm ready to pick a fight
Crawl out of the dark to shine a light
I ain't throwing stones, got sins of my own
Ain't everybody just trying to find a way home
Can I be happy now?
Can I let my breath out
Let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just wanna scream out loud
Can I be happy now?
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turning my world around
You're born then you die, and it's gone in a minute
I ain't looking back, 'cause I don't want to miss it
You better live now
Cause no one's going to get out alive
Can I be happy now?
Can I let my breath out
Let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just wanna scream out loud
Can I be happy now?
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turning my world around
Can I be happy now? - (oohoohooh)
I'm turning my world around
Can I be happy now?
