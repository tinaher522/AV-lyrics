<song artist="Bon_Jovi" title="Walk_Don't_Run">
Another night in this old town
Sometimes growin up can only bring you down
Sometimes I sit, I wonder
Sometimes I scream as loud as thunder
Little brother dont you know Im a man
They might think Im just a boy
But they dont understand
These city streets, they tell me stories about busted dreams and faded glory
No one seems to understand,
They tell me walk, dont run, the time will find you
Walk, dont run and your heart will guide you to
Walk, dont run, they say growing up it just aint so much fun
I feel like a loaded gun
They say dont run
My mom and dad work every day
Just to keep shoes on our feet they slaved their lives away
Grandpa had to do the same, it took him to an early grave
Call me a rebel, say the boy dont think
Im old enough to fight for my country
I aint old enough for a drink
And Im not a pawn, I cant play their game
But Poppa Im proud just to wear your name
Then he held out his hand, he said I understand
But remember walk, dont run, the time will find you
Walk, dont run and your heart will guide you to
Walk, dont run, just walk, dont run
