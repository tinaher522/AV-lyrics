<song artist="Pharrell_Williams" title="Happy">
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news talking this and that (yeah)
Give me all you got, don't hold back (yeah)
Well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine (yeah)
No offense to you don't waste your time
Here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
(Happy) bring me down, can't nothin'
(Happy) bring me down, your love is too high
(Happy) to bring me down, can't nothin'
(Happy) bring me down, I said tell you now
(Happy) bring me down, can't nothin'
(Happy) bring me down, your love is too high
(Happy) to bring me down, can't nothin'
(Happy) bring me down, I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
(Happy) bring me down, can't nothin'
(Happy) bring me down, your love is too high
(Happy) to bring me down, can't nothin'
(Happy) bring me down, I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, eh eh eh
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, hey
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
