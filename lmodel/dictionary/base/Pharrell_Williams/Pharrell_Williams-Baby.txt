Excuse I'm takin' to you...hey...
Aye girl, I just want to talk to you for a minute...Ow
(Verse 1)
Manolo pumps is tappin' and you lips stick's red
(we're just eye fuckin', eye fuckin')
Your Louie purse and I just think I love your hair
(we're just eye fuckin', eye fuckin')
Meet me in the hallways where the bathrooms are
(we're just eye fuckin', eye fuckin')
Can you drive a stick I wanna know I can be your car
(wooo)
(Chorus)
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Are you by yourself tonight, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Excuse me I'm talkin' to you...hey
(Verse 2)
I can imagine havin' my arms 'round you back
(we're just eye fuckin', eye fuckin')
And I can imagine your heartbeat pumpin' through you chest
(we're just eye fuckin', eye fuckin')
I hope it goes beep beep, beep beep, beep beep
beep beep, beep beep,
Excuse me I'm talkin' to you
(hey)
(Chorus)
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Are you by yourself tonight, I wanna touch you

I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Excuse me I'm talkin' to you...hey

Yea boo I see you too, Damn right I wanna do you too
In ya eyes I can tell what you thinkin'

Jump off the yacht and jet ski the runway

Moan and scream out (baby)
Do the things that will make you say (uhh)
Damn right I spoils my (baby)

Million dolla boy type (baby)
Excuse me I'm talkin' to you
(Hook)
Girl you ain't gotta close your eyes or wish real hard or click your heels
I can make everything that you feel be real
(Chorus x2)
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Are you by yourself tonight, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you

Excuse me I'm talkin' to you...hey
