(Pharrell:)
we do this in our sleep ...
Yes sir 
(Snoop Dogg:)
You ever been in love before? 
Let me holla at you mann 
You know it's hard for a playa to admit that sometimes 
But I'm a spit that sumtimes 
You know wat I'm sayin' 
Ay p, give it to em one time, nephew 
(Pharrell and Charlie:)
There's sumthin bout this girl 
From around my way 
Ever try to hold back your feelings, 
But it just wouldn't stay? 
But when I finally found the words to say 
I wanted to run away 
Simply run away 
(Pharrell:)
You can try to run and hide 
It wont make a difference 
You can lie to urself 
Of the reason 
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
That your in love with the girl 
Yessir, that's her 
But it wasn't like that back wen I met her 
The lavish life from all the do? spun 
Before the double R had the hitchhike thumb 
Her friends didn't like niggas like us but i 
Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed 
Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up 
But there's more to it 
I remember once 
Sayin' let's shit on the peons 
Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion 
Make em say 'wat we on??
You say no like u was doin it for eons 
Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons 
Wen it rains it pours 
I laughs to myself wen I change the score 
You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more 
And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy 
I guess he played games 
There's only diamond dice here 
Not tryin' ta justify 
But wen ya shut ya eye you can touch the sky 
You in trouble ma 
And you should pray about speed 
But if this bout you
Wat that say about me? 
(Pharrell and Charlie:)
But when I finally found the words to say 
I wanted to run away 
Simply run away 
(Pharrell:)
U can try to run and hide 
It wont make a difference 
U can lie to urself 
Of the reason 
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
That ur in love with the girl 
(Snoop Dogg:)
See I'm a crip in dark blue chucks 
And I does wat I does 
Yea I might say 'cuz? 
It's really weird cuz a nigga got love 
Snop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a what??
She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug 
Now it is wat it is and it was how it was 
I'm hollin lil mama like wat 
Money mo stacked tryin ta get my g's back 
All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser 
Laid back while we sippin on a breeza 
Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza 
Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza? 
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas 
Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was likeÂ ?JESUS!? 
It's been a lil min since I seen her 
Hope her man don't run up cuz ill have to pull the neena 
(Pharrell and Charlie:)
There's sumthin bout this girl 
From around my way 
Ever try to hold back your feelings, 
But it just wouldn't stay? 
But when I finally found the words to say 
I wanted to run away 
Simply run away 
(Pharrell and Charlie:)
You can try to run and hide 
It wont make a difference 
You can lie to urself 
Of the reason 
Sure it hurts wen it comes to your attention 
That your in love with the girl.
