<song artist="Pharrell_Williams" title="Know_Who_You_Are">
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin'
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin'
 
Bad day at work, crazy boss, crazy or worse
Finger pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a seal
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress
When your environment seems to get brighter
You know it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
You know it's good
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
You know it's good
Perception that you never had
You know it's good, yeah
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin'
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin'
 
I want every woman to make a pledge with me
Say your name, I pledge to live life on the edge
Want you to know, I see, the power is in me
No more acquiesce, standin' up, with no stress
I will do, what I need, till every woman on the earth is free
 
When your environment seems to get brighter
You know it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
You know it's good
And you imagine this started with a lighter
You know it's good
Perception that you never had
You know it's good, yeah
 
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin' (feelin') oh yeah
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin', let me tell you one more time
 
Let me tell you all one time, 'cause I don't mind
I know what you're feelin', feelin', feelin'
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin'
 
And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind
And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time
We just shake our heads and dance, the moment so surreal
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels
Yeah
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin', what you're feelin' yeah
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin', yes I know what you're feelin'
Let me tell you one more time
And I don't mind
And I know what you're feelin' 
I know who you are
And I know what you're feelin'
Yes I do
