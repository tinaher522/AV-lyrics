Little better 
yup 
little skateboard p 
yes sir 
yes sir 
yes sir 
yes sir 
(Verse 1) 
Ma the way you huggin' on me is a problem what the fuck you tryin' to end up in the gossip column 
I know I got jewels like I'm the pharroah of the ghetto 
but we are in the bright ass shiny carrara 
stickin' your feet out the window so they can see your stillettos 
costs a thousand dollahs same as your house n holla 
not to mention your wrists and the 30,000 collah 
pussy must be good he's victim to your power....shit 
that nigga like me I would never allow it
spit that shit on me I'd ask you haveyou showered 
you wanna get up in my boat and ride 
take pictues of with the kid up in ocean drive 
go to casatua and sip on calluas at the bar talking to other women about the best jewelers 
you would like that huh... 
smile and still call your girlfriend 
who fell asleep at the wheel 
(chorus) 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit tryin' to ask me shit 
(Verse 2) 
Hey yo I walk in brashest 
certainly the crassest 
the restuarants classes 
the owners is ass 
my money is green like the helmet of a fashess 
so what you want patrone no patrussi in glasses 
aint no mystery his daughter knows the history 
and every night we toast like its victory get with me 
and i aint change sense my early intel 
I've been snackin on shrimp and sippin on shirrley temples 
What you want 
no seriously what you thinkin sense the yukon 
never puffed a jay you ask lou shaun 
back when he pushed babes like it was like coupons 
with a house full of dames like it was moulon 
I would ask there name but they would only do shaun 
and I aint sayin they regret it but fuck would they do but if they could reverse time what the fuck would they do 
(chorus) 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit tryin to ask me shit 
(Verse 3) 
honeys pandomania eyes like a rainion lighter than the blue of the sky or the day we in 
ass like a volleyball 
kind that make your dick hard 
head to the hustlas so sweet she can get cars 
now she here with me little skateboard p cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps 
I spit then I hit then I murk yes sir 
I flick chicos sticks and a twix thats her 
she admire how a champion lives how I sign Ja Rule with a ramp in my crib 
I'm a champion i do as a champion did except I improve with the new and the rest get rid 
but some ya'll dont like that it seems you tryin to bite back instead of sayin hi gettin fly but ill be right back 
my dude got the skills if you think your fly 
shoot the wings of your egoand watch you sky dive 
(chorus) 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit.......raspy shit 
dont try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit tryin to ask me shit.
