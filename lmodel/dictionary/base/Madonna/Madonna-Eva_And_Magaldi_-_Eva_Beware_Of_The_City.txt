<song artist="Madonna" title="Eva_And_Magaldi_-_Eva_Beware_Of_The_City">
[Eva:]
To think that a man as famous as you are
Could love a poor little nothing like me
[Chorus:]
[Eva:]
I wanna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
[Eva's family:]
She wants to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
[Che:]
Just listen to that, they're on to you Magaldi
I'd get out while you can
[Eva:]
It's happened at last, I'm starting to get started
I'm moving out with my man
[Magaldi:]
Now Eva don't get carried away
[Eva:]
Monotony past, suburbia departed
Who could ever be fond of the back of beyond?
[Magaldi:]
Don't hear words that I didn't say
[Eva's family:]
What's that? You'd desert the girl you love?
[Magaldi:]
The girl I love?
What are you talking about?
[Eva's family:]
She really brightened up your out-of-town engagement
She gave you all she had, she wasn't in your contract
You must be quite relieved that noone's told the papers, so far
[Eva:]
I wanna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would stay together
[Eva's brother:]
Seems to me there's no point in resisting
She's made up her mind, you've no choice
Why don't you be the man who discovered her
You'll never be remembered for your voice
[Magaldi:]
The city can be paradise for those who have the cash
The class and the connections, what you need to make a splash
The likes of you get swept up in the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class ...
[Eva:]
Screw the middle classes! I will never accept them!
My father's other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight, hidden from view at his funeral.
[Eva's brother:]
Do all your one night stands give you this trouble?
[Magaldi:]
Eva beware of the city
It's hungry and cold, can't be controlled, it is mad
Those who are fools are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become what they should not become
Changed, in short, they go bad.
[Eva:]
Bad is good for me
I'm bored, so clean, and so ignored
I've only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here, so why oh why oh why the hell can't I?
I only want variety, of society
[chorus]
[Magaldi:]
Five years from now I shall come back
And finally say, "You have your way, come to town."
But you'll look at me with a foreigner's eyes
The magical city, a younger girl's city
A fantasy long since put down
[Eva:]
All you've done to me, was that a young girl's fantasy?
I played your city games alright, didn't I?
I already know what cooks, how the dirty city feels and looks
I tasted it last night, didn't I?
I'm gonna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
[Eva and family:]
She's gonna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
[Magaldi:]
Eva beware your ambition
It's hungry and cold, can't be controlled, will run wild
This in a man is danger enough, but you are a woman 
Not even a woman, not very much more than a child
And whatever you say, I'll not steal you away
