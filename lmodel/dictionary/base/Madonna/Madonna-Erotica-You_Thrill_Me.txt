<song artist="Madonna" title="Erotica-You_Thrill_Me">
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic
You are who you are
And I wouldn't want to change a thing
In spite of all the pain that love can bring
Tell me what can I do
I'm so in love with you
You thrill me
Surround me, you fill me
You send me
You put me in a trance
You fill me
Inside me you take me
You thrill me
You put me in a trance
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
 
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
You are who you are
And I wouldn't want to change a thing
In spite of all the pain that love can bring
Tell me what can I do
I'm so in love with you
You thrill me
Surround me, you fill me
You send me
You put me in a trance
You fill me
Inside me you take me
You thrill me
You put me in a trance
