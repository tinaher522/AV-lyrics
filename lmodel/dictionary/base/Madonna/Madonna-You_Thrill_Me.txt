<song artist="Madonna" title="You_Thrill_Me">
Tell me do you love me (6x)
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
(3x)
You are who you are
And I
Wouldn't want to change a thing
In spite of
All the pain that love can bring
Tell me
What can I do?
I'm so in love with you
You thrill me
Surround me you fill me
You send me
You put me in a trance
You thrill me
Inside me you take me
You thrill me
You put me in a trance
All over me (4x)
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
(3x)
Erotic, erotic
All over me (4x)
You are who you are
And I
Wouldn't want to change a thing
In spite of
All the pain that love can bring
Tell me
What can I do?
I'm so in love with you
You thrill me
Surround me you fill me
You send me
You put me in a trance
You thrill me
Inside me you take me
You thrill me
You put me in a trance
Erotic, erotic (4x)
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
(3x)
Erotic, erotic
Erotica
Romance
Erotica
I'd like to put you in a trance
All over me (4x)
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
(3x)
Erotic, erotic
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
(3x)
Erotic
