<song artist="Madonna" title="Sorry_(Remix)">
Speak
Don't say forgive me
Don't say you're sorry
I can't take it anymore
Can't take it, can't take it
Can't take it, can't take it anymore
Listen to your lies and all you stories
And I, and I can't take it anymore
Can't take it, can't take it
Can't take it, can't take it anymore
Don't say forgive me
I've heard it all before 
Don't say you're sorry
I've seen it all before
And I've heard it all before
Don't talk, don't speak
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
