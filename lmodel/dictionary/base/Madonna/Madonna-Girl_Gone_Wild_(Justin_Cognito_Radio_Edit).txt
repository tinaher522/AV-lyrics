<song artist="Madonna" title="Girl_Gone_Wild_(Justin_Cognito_Radio_Edit)">
It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic (erotic)
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's comin' right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums!
It's got me singing
Hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor till the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
The room is spinnin'
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinnin'
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favourite song
Turn me on
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's comin' right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums!
It's got me singing
Hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor till the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun
I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave, misbehave
But I'm a bad girl anyway, hey!
Hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor till the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
