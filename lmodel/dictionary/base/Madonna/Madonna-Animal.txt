<song artist="Madonna" title="Animal">
I can practice restraint if thats what you want
Let me zip up my boots we can go for a walk
If i ring you in you can follow my lead
We can ride so fast just remember to breathe
If you start to get up then I'll tighten my grip
If you try to talk back I'll be usin' my whip
Might get hard to hear you with my bit(?) in your mouth
If it starts to hurt then you'll have to scream out
(Chorus)
There's no use goin' back cuz the damage is done
Throw away all the rules, cuz there's gonna be none
Go on and let yourself go cuz there's no time to think
And now I'm in control of your animal instinct
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you misbehave I can make you submit
If you start to act out I can force you to grip
If you want me to beg you I can bring you the heel(?)
Won't be hard to tame you when its me that you feel (whoa)
(Chorus)
There's no use goin' back cuz the damage is done
Throw away all the rules, cuz there's gonna be none
Go on and let yourself go cuz there's no time to think
And now I'm in control of your animal instinct
There's no use goin' back cuz the damage is done
Throw away all the rules, cuz there's gonna be none
Go on and let yourself go cuz there's no time to think
And now I'm in control of your animal instinct
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
