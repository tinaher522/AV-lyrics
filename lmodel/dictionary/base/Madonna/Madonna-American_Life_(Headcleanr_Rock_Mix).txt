Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
(Spoken:)
I'm drinkin' a soy latte
I get a double shot;
It goes right through my body
And you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper
And I'm feeling super-duper
Yo they tell me I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out their bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm diggin' on the isotope
This metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point-of-view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems
Chorus (twice):
American life [American life]
I live the American dream [American dream]
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream [American life]
(Repeat "Spoken")
Repeat Chorus (twice)
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name? [American life]
Am I gonna be a star? [I'm the American dream]
Do I have to change my name? [American life]
Am I gonna be a star?
