<song artist="Madonna" title="Living_For_Love_-_Carry_On">
('Cause I'm living for love...)
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up and I can do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart
Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up
Love's gonna lift me up
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best and it's not you
I picked up my pound, put it back in my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget
Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up
Love's gonna lift me up
Love, love lift me
Love, love lift me
God forgive me
I'm gonna carry on
Love, love lift me
Love, love lift me
God forgive me
Love's gonna lift me up
Love, love lift me
Love, love lift me
God forgive me
Love's gonna lift me up
Up, up, up
Love lift me out, out, out
Love's gonna lift me up
Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up
Come on, come on, come on
I need you to
Lift me up up up
Come on
Lift me up lord
