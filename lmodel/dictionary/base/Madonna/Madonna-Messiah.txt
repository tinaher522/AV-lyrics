<song artist="Madonna" title="Messiah">
I am the promise that you cannot keep
Reap what you sow, find what you seek
I am the sorceress down in the deep
I am the earth under your feet
I am the moon with no light of my own
You are the sun guarding your throne
I heard the angels whisper to me
Look for the signs, he is the one
I'll light a candle here in the dark
Making my way to your heart
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo 
'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too
'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too
I'll be the bride that is married to life
You are the day, I am the night
Weave you a blanket of silver and gold
I'll keep you warm, do as I'm told
I need your strength, it will keep me from harm
I'll be your Queen, safe in your arms
Don't want to get to the end of my days
Saying I wasn't amazed
I'll light a candle here in the dark
Making my way to your heart
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo 
'Til you wake up and you find
I'll light a candle here in the dark
Making my way to your heart
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo
'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too
'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too
'Til you wake up and you find that you love me too
