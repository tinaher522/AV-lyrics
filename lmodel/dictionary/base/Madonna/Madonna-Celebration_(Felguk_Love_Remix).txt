Feel good
Come join the party
Do it
Let's get this started
Feel good
Do it
Feel good
Do it
I say - Do it
Feel good
Do it
I say do it
Feel good
Feel good
It's a celebration
Let's get this started - it's a celebration
Come join the party, it's a celebration
An anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Come join the party, it's a celebration
An anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Yeah
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance? 
Yeah
Come join the... party... - it's a celebration...
Let's get this started... - it's a celebration...
Come join the party, it's a celebration
An anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Come join the party, it's a celebration
An anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Feel good
Do it
Feel good
