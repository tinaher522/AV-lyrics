Hey! Uh. C'mon. Madonna. Break it.
[Madonna:]
Come on boy, I've been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll
[Justin:]
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll
[Madonna:]
I want somebody to speed it up for me then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
[Justin:]
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? (are you ready to go?)
[Madonna &amp; Justin:]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word and Imma give you what you want
[Madonna:]
Time is waiting

Grab a boy

[Justin:]
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh, hey
[Madonna:]
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
[Justin:]
But if I die tonight
At least I can say 
I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?
[Madonna &amp; Justin:]

If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word and Imma give you what you want
