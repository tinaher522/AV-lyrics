A copper
How do ya like that boys? A copper
And we went for it, I went for it
Treated him like a kid brother
And I was gonna split
Fifty-fifty with a copper
They were there waitin'
To pin a medal on him
Come on get up
Get your hands up
Yeah, that's it, a nice gold
Medal for the copper
Only maybe he's gonna
Get it sooner
Than he thinks
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
You think you can have
My love for free
Well, I've got news for you
That's not the way it's gonna be
So don't come hangin'
'Round my door
If you're not ready to give
You're not gonna get much more
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna
Gonna have to play my way
Come on, make my day
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Can you feel the rhythm
Of my mind?
Boy, I've got so much to give
But I don't want to waste my time
I can't let my heart
Put on a show
'Til you surrender baby
You've got to let it go
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna
Gonna have to play my way
Come on, make my day
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Drop your weapons
You'd better come clean
I've got you covered
I'll catch you when you fall to me
I'm not gonna hurt you
'Cause I'm not that kind
We're not goin' nowhere
'Til you have a change of mind
You haven't got a chance
Come out with your hands up
Come out with your hands up
The man says
How do ya like that, ma? Heh
Here's my answer, you dirty
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna
Gonna have to play my way
Come on, make my day
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
(Come on baby make my day)
'Cause my love is dangerous
(Gonna have to play my way)
Get up, stand tall
(Put your back up against the wall)
'Cause my love is dangerous
(This is a bust)
Get up, get up, get up, get up
(Stand tall)
'Cause my love is dangerous
(This is a bust)
I'm so good for you, baby, here I come
I'm gonna get to you before the day is done
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
(Come on baby make my day)
'Cause my love is dangerous
(Gonna have to play my way)
Get up, stand tall
