Madonna feat Justin Timberlake and Timbaland - 4 Minutes Lyrics
Timbaland:I'm out of time
And all I got is 4 minutes, 4 minutes
Madonna: Come on boy, I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Justin: Well don't waste time, give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll
Madonna: I want somebody to speed it up for me then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Justin: Girl, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at.
Are you ready to go, Are you ready to go
Madonna and Justin:
If you want it, You already got it
If you've thought it, It better be what you want
If you feel it, It must be real just?
Say the word, and I will give you what you want
Madonna: Time is waiting
Justin: We only got 4 minutes to save the world
Madonna: No hesitating
Madonna: Grab a boy
Justin: Grab a girl
Madonna: Time is waiting
Justin: We only got 4 minutes to save the world
Madonna: No hesitating
Justin: We only got 4 minutes, 4 minutes
Keep it up ?..
Madonna
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
That's right, keep it up
Keep it up, don?t?.
Madonna, uh
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Madonna: Sometimes I think, what I need is a you intervention, yeah
Justin: And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, ooh, hey hey
Madonna: The road to heaven, paved with good intentions, yeah
Justin: But if I got a night
At least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how bout you?
Madonna and Justin:
If you want it, You already got it
If you've thought it, It better be what you want
If you feel it, It must be real just?
Say the word, and I will give you what you want

Madonna: No hesitating
Madonna: Grab a boy
Justin: Grab a girl
Madonna: Time is waiting
Justin: We only got 4 minutes to save the world
