<song artist="Madonna" title="Hung_Up_(SDP's_Extended_Vocal)">
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly...
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly...
I'm hung up on you
I'm hung up on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing
Every little thing
Hung Up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Waiting for your call
Fed Up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hangin' up on you
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly...
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly
So slowly...
I don't know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing
Every little thing
Hung Up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Waiting for your call
Fed Up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Please hang up and try again
