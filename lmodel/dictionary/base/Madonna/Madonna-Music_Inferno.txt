<song artist="Madonna" title="Music_Inferno">
Alright boys and girls it's time to get your dance shoes on.
You're listening KUMT. 
It's all Madonna, all the time.
(Instrumental)
Do you like to boogie-woogie? X3
Do you like to?
Do you like to boogie-woogie? X3
Do you like to?
I wanna dance with my baby.
Dance with my baby.
Dance with my baby.
Dance with my baby....
Hey Mr. D.J. put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby.
And when the music starts I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy.
Music makes the people come together.
Yeah.
Music makes the bourgeoisie and rebel.
Do you like to boogie-woogie? X3
Do you like to?
Think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie.
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday.
Music makes the people come together.
Yeah.
Music makes the bourgeoisie and rebel.
Music makes the people come together.
Yeah.
Music makes the bourgeoisie and rebel.
Hey Mr. D.J.
(Instrumental)
I wanna dance with my baby.
Dance with my baby.
Dance with my baby.
Dance with my baby....
Music makes the people come together.
Yeah.
Music makes the bourgeoisie and rebel.
