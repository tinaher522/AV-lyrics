<song artist="Madonna" title="Nothing_Fails_(Nevins_Mix)">
I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me.
It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one.
You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall.
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one.
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, nothing fails.
I'm not religious, but I feel so moved
Makes me want to pray
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious, but I feel such love
Makes me want to pray.
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause you're the one.
I'm not religious, but I feel so moved, mmm
I'm not religious, makes me wanna pray
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel so moved
Makes me want to pray (But I feel so moved, mmm)
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel such love
Makes me want to pray (Makes me wanna pray)
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears, nothing fails…
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears, nothing fails…
Nothing fails, nothing fails, no more fears…
