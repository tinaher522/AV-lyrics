<song artist="Madonna" title="Future_Lovers">
Spoken:
I'm gonna tell you... about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills, and loans
Come with me
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
Spoken:
In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride 
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide love inside their eyes
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
Not controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free
Put away your past
Love will never last
If you're holding on to a dream that's gone
Spoken:
I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
There's no love... like the future love
Come with me
Ooo, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Ooo, It's so good, It's so good, It's so good, It's so good, It's so good
Ooo, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I'm feel love
I feel love, I feel love
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride 
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Not controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free
I feel love, I feel love
