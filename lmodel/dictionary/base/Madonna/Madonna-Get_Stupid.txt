<song artist="Madonna" title="Get_Stupid">
GET STUPID (Contain excerpts from 4 Minutes, 
Give It 2 Me, Beat Goes On, Voices)
Who is the master and who is the slave? (Robotic Voice)
Tic Tac, Tic Tac (x4)
Get Stupid... (Get Stupid) (x4)
Get Stupid... Don't Stop it... (Get Stupid)
Get up...
It's time...
Your life...
Your world...
Get up...
It's time...
Your life...
Your choice...
It's time for you to read the signs
Your world...
Your choice...
You don't have the luxury of time
Tic Tac, Tic Tac (...repeat)
Get Stupid... (Get Stupid) (x4)
Get Stupid... Don't Stop it... (Get Stupid)
Get up...
It's time...
Your life...
Your world...
Get up...
It's time...
Your life...
Your choice...
You have got to say what's on your mind
The time is now...
If you wait too long it'll be too late
Let's go... (x4)
The time is right now
You got to decide
Say what you like
There ain't no time to loose (x2)
The time is right now (...it's time)
You got to decide (...get up)
Say what you like (...the time)
There ain't no time to loose (...is now) (x2)
