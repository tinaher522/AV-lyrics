<song artist="Madonna" title="Queen">
It will never rain, never rain
If the great sky falls down, no rain, no more rain
Blood’s pouring down, high alert, we watch it burn
It’s a world undeceived, sirens, sirens
Everyone’s whispering, the CIA, MI6
Hire the unknown
We’re at the end of days
For heaven’s sake
The queen’s been slain
She’ll never rule again
The queen’s been slain
She’ll never rule again
Your queen’s been slain
Queen’s been slain
Black
 parade, motorcade
Destiny sings farewell, church bells
Is anyone listening, everywhere, bowed in prayer
Tears are falling, coming down, coming down
I hear the heavens calling, providence, no evidence
There’s no confirmation
Only silence remains
We only know one thing
The queen’s been slain
She’ll never rule again
The queen’s been slain
She’ll never rule again
Your queen’s been slain
Queen’s been slain
Who will take her place?
It’s written on everyone’s face
The truth is slowly dawning
I hear tomorrow calling
Some things can’t be replaced
The realization of a new generation
On the eve of imitation
All gone, overthrown
The queen’s been slain
She’ll never rule again
The queen’s been slain
She’ll never rule again
Your queen’s been slain
Queen’s been slain
May God bless you all
May God bless you all
May God bless you all
