<song artist="Madonna" title="To_Love_You">
Where has nature gone? 
Is loving you wrong? 
To love, and to be loved 
That's what my life should be about 
I reach your lips, we share a kiss 
And I fall. 
To love and to be loved by you 
To love you is all I can do 
And for always 
To love and to be loved by you 
To love you is all I can do 
To love and be loved 
That's what life's all about 
Keeps the stars coming 
What makes a sad heart sing 
I'm falling.... 
To love and be loved 
That's what living is for 
My goal is greater than this 
To reach your lips to share your kiss 
To love and to be loved by you 
To love you is all I can do 
And for always 
To love and to be loved by you 
To love you is all I can do 
To stay in your arms  
Is the dream I pursue 
To be sheltered from the storm 
To be cozy and ever so warm 
Simply to love you 
To love and to be loved by you 
To love you is all I can do 
And for always 
To love and to be loved by you 
To love you is all I can do 
And for always to love  
And be loved by you.
