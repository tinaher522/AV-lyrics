<song artist="Madonna" title="Love_Consumes_All">
He's a visitor from above
He's been dreaming of a selfish kind of love
He has the moon
But he wants the peoples hearts
His ideals are from afar
He might seem appealing
But it's your soul he's stealing
Your gonna float up to the stars
We will surrender
We will forget the world we knew
We will not fight it
'cause what is fought will be for you
We fall behind him
And you haven't got a clue
That his love consumes you 
He is so divine, just what you need
But he is just not what he seems to be
He blotted out the sun
He packed away the stars
He turns around 
And blows a kiss
Your body sets on fire
As he wispers this
We will surrender
We will forget the world we knew
We will not fight it
'cause what is fought will be for you
We fall behind him
And you haven't got a clue

That his love consumes you 
As the world swings in darkness
The stars hover in anticipation 
Time can only tell
just what he's done
but be assured that
This war will not be won
We will surrender
We will forget the world we knew
We will not fight it
'cause what is fought will be for you
We fall behind him
And you haven't got a clue
That his love consumes you 
We will surrender
(We will surrender)
We will forget the world we knew
We will not fight it
'cause what is fought will be for you
(ooooooo)
We fall behind him
And you haven't got a clue
We will surrender
(We will surrender)
We will forget the world we knew
We will not fight it
'cause what is fought will be for you
(ooooooo)
We fall behind him
And you haven't got a clue
That his love consumes you
