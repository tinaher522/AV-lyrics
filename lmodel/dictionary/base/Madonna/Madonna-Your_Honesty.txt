<song artist="Madonna" title="Your_Honesty">
It's your honesty
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty
Pulling me closer to you baby
You know you drive me crazy
You are one of a kind
And I want you to be mine, all mine
Pulling me closer to you 
You have a special quality
You're bringing out the best in me
You have a special quality
You are 
Pulling me closer to you 
It's your honesty
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty
Pulling me closer to you baby
You know it just gets better
This is the way it should be
You know the truth will set you free, so free
Pulling me closer to you 
You have a special quality
You're bringing out the best in me
You have a special quality
You are 
Pulling me closer to you 
It's your honesty
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty
Pulling me closer to you baby
Touch my little body 
Embrasse-moi mon amour 
Pour ce soir, pour toujours 
Touch my little body
Dis-moi la vérité
Oui je sais toujours
You have a special quality 
You're bringing out the very best in me 
You have a special quality
You are 
Pulling me closer to you
Honesty 
It's your honesty
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty
Pulling me closer to you baby
It's your honesty
It's your honesty
