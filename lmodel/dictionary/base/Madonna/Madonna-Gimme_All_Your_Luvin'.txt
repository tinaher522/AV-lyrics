<song artist="Madonna" title="Gimme_All_Your_Luvin'">
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna
I see you coming
And I don't wanna know your name
L-U-V, Madonna
I see you coming
And you're gonna have to change the game
Y-O-U, you wanna
Would you like to try?
Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you'll do fine
As long as you don't lie to me
And pretend to be what you're not
Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time and dance our lives away
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna
Keep trying don't give up
It's if you want it bad enough
L-U-V, Madonna
It's right in front of you
Now tell me what you're thinking of
Y-O-U, you wanna
In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, burgundy is fine
Let's drink the bottle every drop
Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time and dance our lives away
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need
Now it's up to Y-O-U
Are you the one, shall we proceed?
M-A-D, don't make me
L-U-V, it's time for
Y-O-U, it's up to
L-U-V, I want your
Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time and dance our lives away
