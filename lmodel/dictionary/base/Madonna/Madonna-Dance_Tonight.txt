(Justin:)
Hey Madonna, I'm gonna take you it to the club, go
Feels good
(Madonna:)
Move your body
Catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watchin'
But I just wanna give you more
Don't care about nothin'
I'm fallin' for your love in the worst way
(Justin:)
Move closer
I can feel your body rise
The heat from you
And I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say
(Madonna:)
You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more more more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast fast fast
If you want this good thing to last
Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves through the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves through the world
(Madonna &amp; Justin:)
Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
Til the lights go on
In our zone
Do you wanna take it further?
And before too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony?
Or do you wanna keep runnin this race?
J: I'm so into you
M: I've heard it all before
J:What should I do?
M:I told you catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
Cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste
(Madonna:)
You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more more more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast fast fast
If you want this good thing to last
Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves through the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves through the world
(Madonna &amp; Justin:)
Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
Til the lights go on
(Justin)
Now Dance
Dance
Dance
Do you wanna take it further?
Just Dance
(Madonna)
Catch me on the floor
