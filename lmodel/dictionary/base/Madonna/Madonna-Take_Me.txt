<song artist="Madonna" title="Take_Me">
You are who you are (are are)
I'm so in love with you
What can I do
That's where you take me
You take me
Take me
Take me
Love me
What can I do
What can I do
A box of chocolates
A football team
Flowers growing in the garden
Flowers growing in the garden
You are who you are (are are)
I'm so in love with you
What can I do
What can I do
What can I do
What can I do
I'm so in love with you
What can I do
What can I do
What can I do
I'm so in love with you

That's where you take me
You take me
Take me
That's where you take me
You take me
Take me
There is a light
Above my head
Into your eyes
You are who you are (are are)
I'm so in love with you
What can I do
What can I do
What can I do
What can I do
I'm so in love with you
What can I do
What can I do
What can I do
I'm so in love with you
There a light
There a light
A light
There
There
