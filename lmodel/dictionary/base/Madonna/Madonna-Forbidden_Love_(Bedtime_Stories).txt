<song artist="Madonna" title="Forbidden_Love_(Bedtime_Stories)">
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Rejection, love without doubt)
[Repeat]
[Spoken twice in background during first and second verses:]
(Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark)
(Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's gonna break your heart)
(Let go, let go)
I don't, don't care if it's not right
To have your arms around me
I want to feel what it's like
Take all of you inside of me
[Chorus:]
In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish love would feel like this (love would feel like this)
I know that you're no good for me
That's why I feel I must confess
What's wrong is why it feels so right
I want to feel your sweet caress
[Chorus]
If I only had one wish
Love would always feel like this
Wishin' on the stars above
Forbidden love
If I only had one dream
This would be more than it seems
Forbidden love (forbidden love)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
Rejection (Love without doubt)
Is the greatest aphrodisiac
[Chorus, repeat]
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
Love should always feel like this
Heaven forgive me, never forbid me
[Repeat and fade]
