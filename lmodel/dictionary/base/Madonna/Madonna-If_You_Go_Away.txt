<song artist="Madonna" title="If_You_Go_Away">
If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
When the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the night bird song
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail on the sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
And worship the wind
Then if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To hold in my hand
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll ride on you smile
I'll sail on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much
But if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To hold in my hand
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
As I know you must
There'll be nothing left
In the world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
Oh, I'd have been the
Shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might
Have kept me by your side
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
Please, don't go away
