<song artist="Madonna" title="The_Game">
You want, I've got
You take, have not
Your loss, my gain
We're all the same
You're in the game but you don't know it
Get in control or you're gonna blow it
Ask him his name, find out where did he come from
I wanna know if he's really God's son
Is he really God's son?
You have, I lack
We fade to black
Your move, I take
You win, checkmate
We're all sick, but we just can't see it
Call it a trick, but we don't wanna be it
Try to break through all of your defenses
How would it feel to let go of your senses?
Don't forget to ask him his name
If you knew what I knew you'd be doing the same
Ambiguity does us no good
I want everything to be understood
You want, I've got, you take, have not
Your loss, my gain, we're all the same
You have, I lack, we fade to black
Your move, I take, you win, checkmate
We're in a game but we don't know it
Get in control or we're all gonna blow it
Ask him his name, find out where did he come from
I wanna know if he's really God's son
Don't forget to ask him his name
If you knew what I knew you'd be doing the same
Ambiguity does us no good
I want everything to be understood
