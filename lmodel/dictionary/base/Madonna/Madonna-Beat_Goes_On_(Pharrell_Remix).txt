(featuring Pharrell)
Pharrell: 's alright?
Madonna: Let's do something different
Pharrell: Yeah?
Madonna: Yeah, let's change things up
Pharrell: Ok
Madonna: I'm tired of doing the same old thing
Pharrell: You and me, both
Madonna: Let's give people something to think about
Pharrell: Here we go!
Here comes the sun (here comes the sun)
I'm tired of coming undone (oh, coming undone)
There's been so much darkness, too much of the time
I think it's a sign (must be a sign)
Here comes the rain (here comes the rain)
Wash away all the pain (wash away the pain)
Coming together, going apart, I want you to stay
(Hope you wanna stay)
Always a bride's maid, never the bride
Two steps behind, you've got too much pride
Always supporting, never the star (ever the star)
Get it together, 'cause the beat goes on
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
Here comes my hand (here comes your hand)
Take it while you can (take it while you can)
I'll throw you some rope, if it will give you hope
Want you to understand (understand)
Here comes your smile (here comes your smile)
Hope it stays for a while (stays for a while)
You know it's contagious, it might sound outrageous
But, I feel so alive (feel so alive)
Always a bride's maid, never the bride (never the bride)
Two steps behind, you've got too much pride (so much pride)
Always supporting, never the star (ever the star)
Get it together, 'cause the beat goes on
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
I can't keep waiting for you (what?) (come on)
I can't keep waiting (take it down)
Anticipating with you (what?)
You keep me waiting (take it up)
I can't keep waiting for you (what?)
I can't keep waiting (take it down)
Anticipating with you 'cause, see, the beat goes on
Always a bride's maid, never the bride (never the bride)
Two steps behind, you've got too much pride (there's too much pride)
Always supporting, never the star (ever the star)
Get it together, 'cause the beat goes on
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
(come on)
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
(can't keep waiting for you)
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes
(Take it down)
On &amp; on &amp; on the beat goes, on &amp; on &amp; on the beat instrumentation
I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting (take it down)
Anticipating with yo
You keep me waiting (can't keep waiting for you)
I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting (take it down)
Anticipating with you 'cause, see, the beat goes on
'cause see the beat goes on...
