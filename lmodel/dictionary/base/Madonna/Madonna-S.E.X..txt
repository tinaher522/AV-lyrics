<song artist="Madonna" title="S.E.X.">
Oh my God, you're so hot
Hold my hand, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth 'til we break the bed
When you read my mind, get down and discover me
I'm an open door, let you come inside of me
Wanna put my hands around your neck
Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget
Sex, what do you know about sex
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what do you know about sex
Oh my God, you're so hot
Hold my hand, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth 'til we break the bed
You got a bad attitude
I like to grant it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want baby
Oh my God, let me clean your room, I can be your nurse
Got the antidote, please show me where it hurts
Can you be my father, tell me what to do
You can punish me and maybe I will punish you
Sex, what do you know about sex
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what do you know about sex
Oh my God, you're so hot
Hold my hand, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth 'til we break the bed
You got a bad attitude
I like to grant it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want baby
Oh my God
A lesson in sexology
Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfolds, string of pearls
Neck ties, silk scarfs, silver chains, pretty girls
Thigh highs, leather mask, high heels, golden mask
Perfume, switch blade, absinthe, Novocaine
Chopsticks, underwear, barber soap, dental chair
Fish nets, satin sheets, garter belt, raw meat
Candle light, keyhole, leather belt, mink stole
Golden shower, latex thong, licorice whip, strap it on
Oh my God, you're so hot
Hold my hand, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth 'til we break the bed
You got a bad attitude
I like to grant it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want baby
Sex
