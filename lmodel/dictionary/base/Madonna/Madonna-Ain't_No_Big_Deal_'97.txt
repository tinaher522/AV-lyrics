<song artist="Madonna" title="Ain't_No_Big_Deal_'97">
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
Ain't no big deal to say, my love is real
When you reach out, I'll be there
Please don't be afraid to look me in the eye
Sad time is gone, I got no tears to cry
So don't so say you don't know I'm right
When I say we'll get by
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
Ain't no big deal to say, my love is real
When you reach out, I'll be there
Nobody makes me feel the way that you do
Night time's such a thrill when I spend it with you
Now ask me what is on my mind
So I can tell you true
Ain't no big thing, uh, yeah
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out, yeah
Reach out, reach out, yeah
Reach out, reach out, yeah
Reach out, reach out, yeah
Ain't no big thing
Ain't no big thing
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
Ain't no big deal to say, my love is real
When you reach out, I'll be there
Got love for you so strong it's making me high
Don't know what I'll do if you won't give it a try
So now's the time to make it clear
Let me show you why
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
Ain't no big deal to say, my love is real
When you reach out, I'll be there
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Ain't no big deal
Ain't no big thing
Ain't no big deal
Ain't no big thing
Ain't no big deal
Ain't no big thing
