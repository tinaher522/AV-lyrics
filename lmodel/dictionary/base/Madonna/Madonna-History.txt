<song artist="Madonna" title="History">
(Repeat history, just repeat history,...)
I looked all around the world
Nobody has it better than we do
Uh huh
One thing I don't understand
Why don't we help more people 'cause we can
Uh huh
(All around the world, all around the world,...)
Why are we separated
Defined by our greed and hatred
Why aren't we all united
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
How many tragedies will we see before we come together
Uh huh
It's easy to forget we have a power to make things better
Uh huh
I have a dream
But dreams are not for free
We all need to change
Or just repeat history (just repeat history, just repeat history,...)
(All around the world, all around the world,...)
Why are we separated
Defined by our greed and hatred
Why aren't we all united
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
(Just repeat history, just repeat history,...)
