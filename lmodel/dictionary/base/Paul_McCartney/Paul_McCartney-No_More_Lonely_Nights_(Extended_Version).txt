<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="No_More_Lonely_Nights_(Extended_Version)">
No more lonely nights, 
No more lonely nights, 
You're my guiding light, 
I don't want no more lonely nights. 
I can wait another day 
Until I call you. 
You've only got my heart on a string, 
And ev'rything a'flutter, ooh. 
And another lonely night, 
Might take forever. 
We've only got each other to blame, 
It's all the same to me, oh! 
No more lonely nights, 
No more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
I don't want no more lonely nights. 
May I never miss the thrill 
Of being near you. (near you, near you) 
If it takes a number of years, 
I'll turn your tears away. 
But another lonely night 
Might take forever. 
We've only got each other to blame, 
It's all the same to me, oo-ee, yeah. 
No more lonely nights, 
No more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
Want no more, no more lonely nights. 
Mm-mm-mm-mm, 
Mm-mm-mm, 
Mm-mm-mm-mm, 
Mm-mm-mm-mm, 
Mm-mm-mm. 
Well, I don't want no more lonely nights, 
No, no more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
I don't want no more lonely nights. 
Ooh! Might take forever. 
Each other to blame, baby, baby, baby. 
Hey, hey ay. 
I couldn't take it again, ah, I'd be lonely. 
I couldn't take it, 
I couldn't take it again, ah, no, no. 
May I never miss the thrill 
Of being near you. (near you, near you, near you...) 
And if it takes a number of years, 
I'll turn your tears away. 
Mm-mm, I can wait another day until I call you. 
You've only got my heart on a string, 
And ev'rything a'flutter. 
But another lonely night 
Might take forever. (forever, ever, ever) 
We've only got each other to blame, 
It's all the same to me, to me, to me. 
No more lonely nights, 
No, no more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
Don't want no more, no more, no more lonely nights. 
No more lonely nights, 
No more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
Don't want no more, no more, no more lonely nights. 
Oh! 
Ah 
No more lonely nights, 
No, no more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
Don't want no more, no more, no more lonely nights. 
No more lonely nights, 
Night, night, night, night, 
Night, night. 
Mm-mm-mm, baby, baby.
