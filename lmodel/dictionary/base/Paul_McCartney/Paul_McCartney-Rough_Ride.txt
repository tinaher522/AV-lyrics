<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Rough_Ride">
I needed loving
I needed a friend
I needed something
That would be there in the end
On a rough ride to want to get inside
What will I do? 
On a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
I knew you'd help me (help)
I knew you could
You knew I didn't
Want to be misunderstood
On a rough ride to Heaven
Want to be inside, what did I do? 
On a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
I'm not asking for an easy passage 
So I hope you understand
I'm not after any special treatment
But I wouldn't mind a hand
On a rough ride
On a rough ride
On a rough ride, oh
On a rough ride
Rough ride to Heaven
If I want to get inside, what will I do?
What will i do? What will I do?
Rough ride
Eh, rough ride
Yeah, rough ride
On a rough ride to Heaven
Want to get inside, what did I do?
On a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
On a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
On a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
