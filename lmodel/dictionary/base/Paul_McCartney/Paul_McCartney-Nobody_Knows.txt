<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Nobody_Knows">
They say, that nobody knows
No nobody knows
Which one of you can tell me
What it is I’m looking at
Anyone who can
Has got to be a crazy cat
'Cause I believe
That nobody knows, no nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, no
Lord I cannot tell you
Well that's the way I like it
Yeah now, nobody knows
Woo hoo
Woo hoo
Nobody knows
Oh, nobody knows
Well, Lord you know that nobody knows
Samson and Delilah
Would have made a crazy pair
If the silly woman
Hadn't shaven off his hair
I believe that nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows
But that's the way I like it
Yeah now, nobody knows
That's the way I like it, nobody knows
I may go hungry
Maybe next week
Well if I do then
I’ll still find something to eat
And you know, nobody knows
No nobody knows
Well that's the way I like it
Baby, nobody knows
And that includes you, honey (nobody knows)
I'll pay your rent
I'll do you right (nobody knows)
Most every night
But still there's nobody knows
No now, nobody knows
And that's the way I like to keep it
Just so nobody knows
