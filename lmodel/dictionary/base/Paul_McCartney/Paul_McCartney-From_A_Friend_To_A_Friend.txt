<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="From_A_Friend_To_A_Friend">
And when the time comes round
We will be duty bound
To tell the truth of what we've seen
And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see
From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe
Ohh la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away
From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe
And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see
From a lover to a friend
You turned out to be
Someone I believe
From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again
Ohh la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away
From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
Let me love again
