<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Bye_Bye_Blackbird">
Blackbird, blackbird, singing the blues all day
Right outside my door
Blackbird, blackbird, I gotta be on my way
... the sun shines once more.
I pack up all my cares and woes
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye, blackbird.
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet and so is she
Bye bye, blackbird.
No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me.
I'll make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye.
No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me.
I'll make my bed and light the light
I'll be home late tonight
Blackbird, oh blackbird
Blackbird, bye bye.
