<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="So_Like_Candy">
Here lies the powder and perfume 
The pretty clothes are scattered 'round the room 
And it's so like Candy 
Here lies the lipstick and the face 
The colored tablets keep it all in place 
And it's so like Candy 
So like Candy 
What did I do 
To make her go 
Why must she be the one 
That I have to love so
So like Candy 
Here lies a picture of a girl 
Her arms are tight around that lucky guy 
And it's so like Candy 
And in her eyes a certain look 
I thought I'd seen the last of long ago 
And it's so like Candy 
So like Candy 
What did I do 
To make her go 
Why must she be the one 
That I have to love so
I remember the day that picture was taken 
We were so happy then 
But that's so like Candy 
She seemed so sweet to me 
I was mistaken 
Oh no not that again 
But that's so like Candy 
She just can't face the day 
So she turns and melts away 
Here lie the records that she scratched 
And on the sleeve I find a note attached 
And it's so like Candy 
"My Darling Dear it's such a waste" 
She couldn't say "goodbye", but "I admire your taste" 
And it's so like Candy 
So like Candy
