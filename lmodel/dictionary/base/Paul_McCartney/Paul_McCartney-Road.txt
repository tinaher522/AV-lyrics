<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Road">
We came from nowhere hiding from a storm
We cling together to keep each other warm
The road to somewhere stretches through the night
We follow blindly, heading for the light.
I can't see anymore the blinding light
It's just a metaphor I use when things aren't going right.
We held each other praying for a spark
Two crazy partners scrambling in the dark
Now where are we going searching in the nightÂ ?
We had a feeling, it's going to be alright.
I can't see anymore the blinding light
It's just a metaphor I use when things aren't going right.
Oooh
Two crazy partners searching in the night
We've got a feeling, it's gonna be alright
We follow blindly, heading for the light
We got a feeling, it's gonna be, it's gonna be alright.
We came from nowhere hiding from a storm
We cling together to keep each other warm
The road to somewhere stretches through the night
We follow blindly, heading for the light.
Heading for the light
