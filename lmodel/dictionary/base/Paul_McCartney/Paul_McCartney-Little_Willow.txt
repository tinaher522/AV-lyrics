<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Little_Willow">
Bend little Willow
Winds gonna blow you hard and cold tonight.
Life as it happens,
No body warns you, Willow hold on tight.
Nothings gonna shake your love,
Take your love away.
No ones out to break your heart,
It only seems that way.
Sleep little willow,
Peace is gonna follow,
Time will heal your wounds.
Grow to the heavens.
Now and forever,
Always came too soon.
Little Willow
Nothings gonna shake your love,
Take your love away.
No ones out to break your heart,
It only seems that way.
Bend little willow,
Winds gonna blow you hard and cold tonight.
Life as it happens,
No body warns you, Willow hold on tight.
