<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="So_Bad">
There is a pain inside my heart
You mean so much to me
Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you so bad
And if you leave, my pain will go
But that's no good to me
Girl, I love you
Yes, I love you so bad
Well, it feels so good
Sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had
There was a pain, but now you're here
And I don't fear a thing
Girl, I love you
Yes, I love you so bad
And she said
Boy, I love you
Boy, I love you so bad
(I love) Girl, I love you
(I love) Girl, I love you so bad
(I love, I love)
Well, it feels so good
Sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had
There was a pain, but now you're near
And I don't fear a thing
(I love) Girl, I love you
(I love) Girl, I love you so bad
(I love, I love)
And she said
(I love) Boy, I love you
(I love) Boy, I love you so bad
(I love) Girl, I love you
(I love) Girl, I love you
