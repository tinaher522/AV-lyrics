<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Mister_Bellamy">
I'm not coming down
No matter what you
I like it up here without you
Go light, Mister Bellamy
We'll have you down soon
No one to tell me what to do
No one to hold my hand
Bellamy's got a lot to do
And I hope that you'll understand
Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand
Steady lads, and easy does it
Ooh, don't frighten him, here we go
I'm not coming down
No matter what you say
I like it up here anyway
Sit tight, Mister Bellamy
This shouldn't take long
In the delusionary state
No wonder he's been feeling strange, of late
Nobody here to spoil the view
(In the delusionary state)
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
(No wonder he's been feeling strange, of late)
And he's hoping you'll understand
Steady lads, easy does it
Don't frighten him, here we go, here we go
I'm not coming down
No matter what you do
I like it up here without you
Come down, come down, come down to me
Come down
Come down, come down, come down to me
Come down
Come down, come down, come down to me
Come down
Come down, come down, come down to me
Come down
