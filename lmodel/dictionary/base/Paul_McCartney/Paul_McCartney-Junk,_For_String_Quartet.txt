<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Junk,_For_String_Quartet">
Motor cars, handle bars
Bicycles for two
Broken hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree
Buy buy says the sign in the shop window
Why why says the in junk the yard
Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Memories for you and me
Buy buy says the sign in the shop window
Why why says the in junk in the yard
