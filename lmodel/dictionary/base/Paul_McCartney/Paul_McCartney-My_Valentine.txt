<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="My_Valentine">
What if it rained? We didn't care
She said that someday soon the sun was gonna shine
And she was right, this love of mine
My Valentine.
As days and nights would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared, a love so fine
My Valentine.
And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain that I can fly.
And so I do, without a care
I know that someday soon the sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there, this love of mine
My Valentine.
What if it rained? We didn't care
She said that someday soon the sun was gonna shine
And she was right, this love of mine
My Valentine.
