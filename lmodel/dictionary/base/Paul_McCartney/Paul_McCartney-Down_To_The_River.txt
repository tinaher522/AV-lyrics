<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Down_To_The_River">
Now take me down to the river,
Baby, take me down to the river,
You can take me down to the river,
Where the waters flow, oh yeah.
Down to the river,
Can you take me down to the river,
Baby, take me down to the river,
Where the waters flow.
Yeah, well, I know,
Yeah, I know,
Well, I know,
I know I wanna go.
Now, down to the river,
You can take me down to the river,
You can take me down to the river,
Where the waters flow,
Flow, down, down, down.
Oh yeah, taking me, taking me down to the river,
Oh, down, down, down, down, down, yeah,
Down to the river,
Where the waters flow.
Down, take me down.
Take me now.
Down, down, down, down,
Taking me down to the river,
Down to the river,
Will you take me down to the river,
Where the waters flow.
Take me down, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, well, I know,
Ah, well, I know,
Well, I know,I know I wanna go.
Yeah, take me down to the river,
You can take me down to the river,
Can you take me down to the river,
Where the waters flow.
