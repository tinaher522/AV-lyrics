<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Junk">
Motor cars, handlebars
Bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee
Parachutes, Army boots
Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree
Buy, buy
Says the sign in the shop window
Why, why
Says the junk in the yard
Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Memories for you and me
Buy, buy
Says the sign in the shop window
Why, why
Says the junk in the yard
