<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Same_Time_Next_Year">
Must we wait another year
For the celebration, dear?
If we do, we'll hold it here,
Same time next year.
I'll be here, the same as ever,
Maybe wearing something else.
Ah, but nothing changes,
Ah, but nothing changes.
Still to me you look the same
As when I forgot your name,
Lovers in a lovers' game,
Same time next year.
I'll be here, the same as ever,
No, I never go away.
Ah, but nothing changes, (ah, but nothing changes)
Ah, but nothing changes.
Same time next year.
Must we wait another year
For the celebration, dear?
If we do, we'll hold it here,
Same time next year.
Same time next year,
Same time next year,
Same time next year,
Same time next year.
Same time next year
