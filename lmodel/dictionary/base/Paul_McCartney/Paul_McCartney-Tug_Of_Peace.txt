<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Tug_Of_Peace">
It's a tug of war 
No no, your troubles cease when you learn to play the pipes of peace 
It's a tug of war 
No no, your troubles cease when you learn to play the pipes of peace 
What with one thing and another 
It's a tug of war 
No no no no 
Oh
It's a tug of war 
No no, your troubles cease when you learn to play the pipes of peace 
It's a tug of war
Learn to play the pipes of peace
Pushing, pushing 
Pulling, pulling 
Pushing, pulling
"Hey! New ending"
</song>
