<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Beautiful_Night">
Someone's gone out fishing.
Someone's high and dry.
Someone's on a mission, to the lonely Lorelai
Some folks got a vision,
Of a castle in the sky.
And I'm left stranded,
Wondering why.
You and me together,
Nothing feels so good.
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood.
I won't need a castle,
They've got castles in Versailles.
And I'm still stranded,
Wondering why.
Make it a beautiful night for me.
It's a beautiful night for love.
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to be home.
Make it a beautiful night for me.
It's a beautiful night for love.
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to be home.
Some boat's on the ocean.
We're here in this room.
Seems to me the perfect way to spend the afternoon.
We can look for castles,
Pretty castles in the sky.
No more wandering, wondering why.
Things can go wrong, 
Things can go right.
Things can go bump in the dead of the night.
So let me be there,
Let me be there.
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night.
Make it a beautiful night for me.
It's a beautiful night for love.
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to be home.
Make it a beautiful night for me.
It's a beautiful night for love.
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to be home.
Yeah, it's a beautiful night.
Yeah, it's a beautiful night.
Yeah, beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night.
It's such a beautiful night, a beautiful, beautiful night.
