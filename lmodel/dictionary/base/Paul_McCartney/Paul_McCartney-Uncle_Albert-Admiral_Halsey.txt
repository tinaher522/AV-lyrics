<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Uncle_Albert-Admiral_Halsey">
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But there's no one left at home, and I believe I'm gonna rain
We're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring
(human voice imitates telephone ringing)
(distorted voice, as if heard over a telephone)
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil, and we're so easily called away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hands across the water, water
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water, water
Heads across the sky
Admiral Halsey notified me
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea
I had another look and I had a cup of tea 
And butter pie 
(A butter pie?)
The butter wouldn't melt, so I put it in a pie
Hands across the water, water
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water, water
Heads across the sky
Live a little, be a gypsy
Get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
Live a little, be a gypsy
Get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
Hands across the water, water
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water, water
Heads across the sky
