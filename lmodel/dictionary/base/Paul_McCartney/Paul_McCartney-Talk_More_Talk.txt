<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Talk_More_Talk">
A master can highlight the phrases, 
Sleasy instruments, half talked, half baked ideas...
Dad, you didn't say o.k...
The window was open, outside was a spaceship, 
(a master can highlight the phrases) it took off into the sky 
Leaving a trail of smoke behind it... 
Short of the standard. was it the sun? 
What was rehearsal? conventional drum? 
Not quite a hundred. less that a ton. 
Clearly the time came, the plan had begun. 
With talk, more talk. chat, more chat. 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk. chat, more chat. I'm happy to do it for you... 
Developed since earlier days at the school 
Cheapest sensations were used as a rule. 
Outstanding to memory, major free flow. 
Bio-degradable, look out below for... 
Talk, more talk, oh I love to hear the gentle sound 
Of conversation sprinkled around 
A room where I can be at one with you for... 
Talk, more talk. chat, more chat, 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk. chat, more chat. happy to do it for you... 
I'm happy to do it for you... I'm happy to do it for you, 
I'm happy to do it, I'm happy to do it... I'm happy to do it for you. 
Digital organ, finishing stretch, instrumentation, analogue gretsch. 
Not quite a thousand, lower than that. 
Possible bargain for listening at that... 
Talk, more talk. chat, more chat. 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk. chat, more chat. 
I'm happy to do it for you... 
All you want is a handyman and all you want is quick service. 
Because I'm a house owner. I'm a house owner. 
It may be worth something someday. 
I hear water going through the pipes. 
I don't actually like sitting down music. music is idea. 
Talk, more talk. chat, more chat. 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk. chat, more chat. 
A master can tell, highlight the phrases his words to digress 
Grey flannel trousers... grey flannel trousers. 
A blazer and grey flannel trousers.
