<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Singing_The_Blues">
Well, I never felt more like singing the blues
I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love, why'd you do me this way?
Well, I never felt more like crying all night
Everything's wrong, and nothing is right
Without you, you got me singing the blues.
Well The moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-y-y-y over you (cry over you)
Well, I never felt more like running away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singing the blues.
Well, the moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-y-y-y over you (cry over you)
Well, I never felt more like running away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singing the blues.
Well, the moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-y-y-y over you (cry over you)
Well, I never felt more like running away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay
Without you, hey you got me singing the blues.
You got me singing the blues
You got me singing the blues
