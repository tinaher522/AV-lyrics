<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Vintage_Clothes">
Don't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
We jump up for joy
Who cares if we look like a girl or boy
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
A little worn
A little torn
Check the rack
What went out is coming back
Don't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
A little worn
A little torn
Check the rack
What went out is coming back
