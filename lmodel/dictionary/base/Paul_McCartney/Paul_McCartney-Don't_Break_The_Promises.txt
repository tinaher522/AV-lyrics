<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Don't_Break_The_Promises">
Take my life but don't throw it all away, don't break the promise that you made today.
Take my heart but if you're not gonna stay, don't break the promise that you made today.
Ah, don't break the promise that you made today.
If you don't mean to keep your word, well, you better be heading down the road.
Cause I can't, I can't stand it if we don't love life all you gonna do is tell me goodbye.
Take my life but don't throw it all away, don't break the promise that you made today.
Ah, take my heart but don't lose it on the way, ooh, don't break the promise that you made today.
(don't break the promise) don't break the promise that you made today.
Kiss it goodbye, (kiss it) walk if you don't want all, all of my loving.
you know what you can do, baby, kiss it goodbye. (kiss it, kiss it) yeah, yeah.
Ah, take my heart but don't throw it, don't throw it all away,
mm, don't break the promise that you made today.
(don't break the promise) don't break the promise that you made today.
No, no, no, don't break the promise that you made today,
no, no, don't break the promise that you made today.
