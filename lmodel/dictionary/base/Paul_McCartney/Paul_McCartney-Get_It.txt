<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Get_It">
You've got to get it, mmm
You've got to get it, don't forget, 'cause it doesn't come around again
You've got to get it, mmm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good
Once I had a little spanish guitar
The neighbors told me I could go pretty far
Well I came and I went
And my guitar got bent
But I discovered that the people who love
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all
And that's that
Unless the world is flat
I wanna get it, mmm
I wanna get it just in case it doesn't come around again
I wanna get it, mmm
I wanna get it and I wanna get it good
Pardon me if I've been misunderstood 
I wanna get it while the going is good
The telephone rang
About a song I sang
The life of Cadillac and Ultra for sure
Is automatic for the Lady Demure
She came and she went
Without a single dent
You've got to get it, mmm
You've got to get it, don't forget, 'cause it doesn't come around again
You've got to get it, mmm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good
Come on, let's get it, mmm
Come on, let's get it don't forget, 'cause it doesn't come around again
You've got to get it, mmm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good
