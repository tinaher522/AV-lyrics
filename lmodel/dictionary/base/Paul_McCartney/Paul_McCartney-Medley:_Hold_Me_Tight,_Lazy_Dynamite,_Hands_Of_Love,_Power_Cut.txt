Lazy Dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Won't you come out tonight 
When the time is right 
Oh will you fight that feeling in your heart 
Don't you know that inside 
There's a love you can't hide 
So why do you fight that feeling in your heart 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh why do you fight that feeling in your heart 
Don't you know that inside 
There's a love you can't hide 
So why do you fight that feeling in your heart 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Oh lazy dynamite 
Doo doo doo .. 
Hands of Love 
I can't get over myself 
Falling into the hands of love 
Just can't imagine myself 
Falling head over heals in love 
But when I saw you last night 
I knew for the first time 
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of 
I cant get over myself 
Falling into the hands of love 
Falling into the hands of love 
But when I saw you last night 
I knew for the first time 
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of 
I can't get over myself 
Falling into the hands of love 
Falling into the hands of love 
Love sweet love 
But when I saw you last night 
I knew for the first time 
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of 
I can't get over myself 
Falling into the hands of love 
Falling into the hands of love 
Love sweet love 
Power Cut 
There may be a powercut 
And the candles burn down low 
But something inside of me 
Says the bad news isn't so 
I may never tell you 
But baby you should know 
There may be a miracle 
And baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
I may never tell you 
But baby you should know 
There may be a miracle 
And baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so 
Baby I love you so
