<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Mr._Bellamy">
I'm not coming down
No matter what you do
I like it up here
Without you
All right Mr Bellamy
We'll have you down soon
No one to tell me what to do
No one to hold my hand
Bellamy's got a lot to do
And I hope that you'll understand
Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand
Steady lads
Easy does it
Don't frighten him
Here we go
I'm not coming down
No matter what you say
I like it up here
Anyway
Sit tight Mr Bellamy
This shouldn't take long
In a delusionary state
No wonder he's been feeling strange of late
Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand
Steady lads
Easy does it
Don't frighten him
Here we go
Here we go
I'm not coming down
No matter what you do
I like it up here
Without you
Come down
Come down
Come back to me
