<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Man_We_Was_Lonely">
Man we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
And we was hard pressed to find a smile
Man we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
But now we're fine all the while
I used to ride on my fast city line
Singing songs that I thought were mine alone (alone), alone
Now let me lie with my love all the time
I am home (home), home (home), home
Man we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
And we was hard pressed to find a smile
Man we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
But now we're fine all the while
Woo!
Now let me lie with my love all the time
I am home (home), home (home), home
Man we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
And we was hard pressed to find a smile
Man we was lonely
Yes, we was lonely
But now we're fine all the while
But now we're fine all the while
But now we're fine all the while
