<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="It's_So_Easy">
I got to one, two, three, four
Well now, it's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Well, people tell me love is for fools
Here I go, I'm breaking all the rules
It seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
It's so doggone easy
Doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy
Oh, it's so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
Well, where you're concerned
My heart has learned
And it's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love, yeah
Yeah, you know it seems so easy
Doggone easy
Oh, it's so easy to fall in love
Yeah, it's so easy to fall in love
Well, look into your heart and see
What your love book has set apart for me
It seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
It's so doggone easy
Doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy
Yeah, it seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
Where you're concerned
My heart has learned
Yeah, it's so easy to fall in love, oh baby
It's so easy to fall in love, yeah, oh yeah
Well, it seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
It's so doggone easy
Doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy

Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
But you know where you're concerned
Baby, my heart has learned
Yeah, it's so easy to fall in love, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna get you, baby

Round about eight o'clock tonight
Yeah, you better be ready, honey
'Cause it's so easy, it's so easy for me
And it's so easy for you, yeah, we're gonna do it
It's so easy to fall in love, you know that
It's so easy to fall in love, yeah
Well, people tell me love is for fools, what you say?
So here I go breaking all of those rules
It seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
It's so doggone easy
Doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy
Oh, it seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
Baby, where you're concerned
My heart has learned
It's so easy to fall in love

Yeah alright, now you're ready about half past eight
But you know what I'm gonna do

We're gonna down by the old juke joint, man
We're gonna be playing them record
We're gonna be dancing, man
We're gonna have such fun 'cause it's so easy
