Well that's all right mama, that's all right for you, that's all right mama, anyway you do, but that's all right, that's all right, that's all right now mama ,anyway you do.
Well mama she done told me, papa done told me too,"son that gal you foolin with she ain't no good for you," but thats all right,thats all right,thats all right now mama, anyway you do.
Im leavin town baby, im leavin town for sure, well then you wont be bothered with me hangin 'round your door, but thats all right, thats all right, thats all right now mama, anyway you do.
