<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Let_Me_Roll_It">
You Gave Me Something, I Understand, 
You Gave Me Loving In The Palm Of My Hand 
I Can't Tell You How I Feel 
My Heart Is Like A Wheel..
Let Me Roll It 
Let Me Roll It To You 
Let Me Roll It 
Let Me Toll It To You. 
I Want To Tell You 
And Now's The Time 
I Want To Tell You That 
You're Going To Be Mine..
I Can't Tell You How I Feel 
My Heart Is Like A Wheel..
Let Me Roll It 
Let Me Roll It To You 
Let Me Roll It 
Let Me Roll It To You.
