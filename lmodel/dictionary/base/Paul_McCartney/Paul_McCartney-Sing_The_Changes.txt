<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Sing_The_Changes">
Like the sun break in the morning
Feel the choir feel the thunder
Every ladder leads to heaven
See the changes draw the picture
Sing the changes as your sleeping
Feel the choir feel the thunder
See the changes going over
Feel the choir feel the thunder
Like the sun play in the morning
Feel the choir feel the thunder
Every lantern needs a handle
Colored pencils draw the picture
Sing your praises as your sleeping
Feel a sense of child like wonder
Sing your praises in the city
New York City here we come now
Feel the thunder feel the choir
In the field taking over
Feel a sense of child like wonder
As your sleeping feel the thunder
Sing the changes everybody
Feel the sense of child like wonder
Whoaa, Whoaa, Whooao
