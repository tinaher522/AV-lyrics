<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Why_So_Blue">
Staring from a cardboard castle, down and out
One of life's young students finds out what it's all about
Paper flooder's, angry taxi-drivers shout
From the pages of a paper, candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two, who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again, the same old line
Why so sad, my fine young friend
Why so blue?
We, we carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that no one's heard from, in a while
Papers from the same old file
Why so sad, my fine young friend
Why so blue?
Sometimes when I meet
You know, they have to meet again
Sometimes, birds of summer
Got to fly together, oh
From a dingy attic window, candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two, who love to dine
Now they drink the highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you, you used to be so blue
You used to be so blue
Why so blue?
