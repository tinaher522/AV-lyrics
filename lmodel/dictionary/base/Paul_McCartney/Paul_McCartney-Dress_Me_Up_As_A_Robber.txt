<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Dress_Me_Up_As_A_Robber">
Well, you can dress me up as a robber
But I won't be in disguise
Only love is a robber
And lives within your eyes
Ooh, ooh-ee-ooh
You can dress me up as a sailor
But I'll never run to sea
As long as your love is available to me
What do I do with a sea of blue
Ooh, ooh-ee-ooh, bop ba, bop ba da da da
Dressing me up
It doesn't make a difference
What you want to do
Whichever way you look at it
I'm still in love with you
If we go on forever
I may never make a change
Dressing me up
And if I don't convince you
You needn't look too far
To see that I'm not lying
'Cause I love the way you are
What's the point of changing
When I'm happy as I am? 
Well, you can dress me up as a soldier 
But I wouldn't know what for
I was the one that told you he loved you
Don't wanna go to another war
No, no, no, ba, bop, ba da da da
