<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Queenie_Eye">
There were rules you never told me
Never came up with a plan
All the stories that you sold me
Didn't help me understand
But I had to get it worked out
Had nobody who could help
So then in the end it turned out
That I had to do it
By myself
Life's a game of rags to riches
Dogs and bitches hunt for fame
Difficult to know which way to turn
Lay the blame on the snitches, 
Wicked witches fan the flame
Careful what you touch in case you burn
Queenie eye, queenie eye who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out that's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
Play the game, take your chances
Every dance is much the same
Doesn't matter which event you choose
Never blame the circumstances,
If romances seldom came, 
Never pick a fight you're gonna lose
Queenie eye, queenie eye who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
It's long way, to the finish
When you've never been before
I was nervous, but I did it
Now I'm going back for more
Here the people shout
Queenie eye, queenie eye who's got the ball?
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
