<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Feet_In_The_Clouds">
Teacher said
I had my head in the clouds
They directed
I suspected
Disconnected
Had it my way
On the street
I had my feet on the ground
Stood corrected
Well protected
Resurrected
Had it my way
I've got my feet in the clouds
Got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square
As long as they're not around
But I find it very very very very very very hard
Yes I find it very very very very very very hard
Love is fab
It's like a stab in the heart
Hidden treasure
Made to measure
For my pleasure
Had it my way
I've got my feet in the clouds
Got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square
As long as they're not around
And I find it very very very very very very hard
And I find it very very very very very very hard
Oh I find it very very very very very very hard
Yes I find it very very very very very very hard
I've got my feet in the clouds
Got my head on the ground
I'm not a square
As long as they're not around
But I find it so hard I find it so hard
