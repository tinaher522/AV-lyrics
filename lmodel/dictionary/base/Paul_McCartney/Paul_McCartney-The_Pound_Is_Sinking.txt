<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="The_Pound_Is_Sinking">
The pound is sinking
The peso's falling
The lira's reeling
And feeling quite appalling
The mark is holding
The franc is fading
The drachma's very weak
But everyone's still trading
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors
Well I fear, my dear
That it's eminently clear
That can't see the trees for the forest
Your father was an extraordinary man
But you don't seem to have inherited
Many of his mannerisms
Oh, any of his mannerisms
The dollar's moving
The rouble's rising
The yen is keeping up
Which hardly seems surprising
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors
Hear me, lover
I can't be held responsible now 
For something that didn't happen
I knew you for a minute
Oh, it didn't happen 
Only for a minute 
Your heart just wasn't in it anymore
The pound is sinking
The peso's falling
The lira's reeling
And feeling quite appalling
