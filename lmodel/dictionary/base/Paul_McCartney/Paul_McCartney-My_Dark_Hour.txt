<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="My_Dark_Hour">
My dark hour
My dark hour, you know it's drivin' me wild
Well, well, I went to see the doctor
And I had my fortune read
And you know the doctor told me
Son you better stay in bed
Who's that comin' down that road
Looks like he's carryin' a heavy load
{??} and he started to say
Want to come with me on my way
My dark hour, mother nature's child
My dark hour, oh, it's drivin' me wild
Well, I went to see the doctor
Just to have my fortune read
Well, well, well, well, well, the doctor told me
Son you better stay in bed
So do you think these sinners will fall
Or do you think they'll survive us all
Well, well, well, well down this road
Won't you help me carry my load
My dark hour, mother nature's child
My dark hour, oh, it's drivin' me wild
