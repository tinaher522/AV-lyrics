<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Get_Me_Out_Of_Here">
I get a feeling when they call my name
Feels like we're all involved in some kind of game
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, let me out of here, yeah.
I hear the taxman knocking at my door
I've got a feeling he'll be asking for more
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here, yeah.
Ah, when we fight I don't know what to say
It feels so bad and yet I can run away
Oh boy, get me out of here
I'm a celebrity, oh boy, someone get me out of here.
I see the doctor coming down the street
I got no fever but I'm feeling the heat
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here.
