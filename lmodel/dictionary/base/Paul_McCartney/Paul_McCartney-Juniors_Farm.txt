<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Juniors_Farm">
You should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand
I was talking to an Eskimo
Said, he was hopping for a fall of snow
When up popped a sea lion, ready to go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Take me down to Jimmy
At the Houses of Parliament
Everybody's talking 'bout the President
We all chip in for a bag of cement
Olly Hardy should have had more sense
He bought a gee-gee and he jumped the fence
All for the sake of a couple of pence
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Let's go, let's go down to
Junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Everybody tag along
I took my bag into a grocer's store
The price is higher than the time before
Old man asked me, "Why is it more"
I said, you should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I wanna lay low
(Down to Junior's Farm)
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
(Down to Junior's Farm)
Let's go, let's go, down to
Junior's farm where I wanna lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
(Down to Junior's Farm)
Everybody tag along
(You also tag along)
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Take me down, take me down
I wanna go there, yeah, yeah
Down, down, yeah
