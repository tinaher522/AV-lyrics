<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Promise_To_You_Girl">
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away
Like the sun that rises every day
We can chase the dark clouds from the sky
I gave my promise to you, girl
I don't wanna take it back
You and me, side by side
We know how to change the world
That is why I gave my promise to you, girl
Hey, why wait another day?
That won't get us anywhere
All the time that it takes
To repair this brave old world
Will be ours, I gave my promise to you, girl
Every single second of our life
We can use to chase the clouds away
Well, there's no more barking up the tree
No more howling at the moon
Same old scene, you and I
Diving for the deepest trust
That is why I gave my promise to you, girl
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away
