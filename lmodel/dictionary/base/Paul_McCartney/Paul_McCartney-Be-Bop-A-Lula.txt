Well 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll 
Well 
She's the one in the red blue jeans 
She's the queen of all the team 
She's the woman walkin' that I know 
She's the woman that loves me so 
Well 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll 
Well 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll 
Well 
She's the woman who's got that beat 
She's the woman with the flying feet 
She's the woman walk around the store 
She's the woman gives me more more more 
Well 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll 
(Come On Wix, Clamp 'Em) 
Well 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby 
Be-Bop-A-Lula don't mean maybe 
Be-Bop-A-Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll
