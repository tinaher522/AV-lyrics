<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Keep_Coming_Back_To_Love">
Ev'ry time I see you,
Admit into something new.
Doing unimportant things,
All the foolish things that other people do.
Ev'rything I'm trying 
Doesn't feel quite right.
And I can't help wondering
Why I ever let you out of my sight.
So I keep coming back to love, wo-oh,
Yes, I keep coming back to love.
Must I keep moving along this track?
I might get restless,
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Because I keep coming back to love.
Ev'rywhere I get to, (oo-oo-oo)
I'm always on my own.
Tryin' to solve a mystery,
And if it was up to me I wouldn't be alone.
Anytime I miss you, (ah-ah)
The feeling is so strong.
But the road I'm travelling
Is filled with echoes of your sweet song.
So I keep coming back to love, wo-oh,
Yes, I keep coming back to love, wo-oh.
Must I keep moving along this track?
If I get restless,
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Because I keep coming back to love.
Oo -
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to love -
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to,
Keep coming, keep coming back to.
