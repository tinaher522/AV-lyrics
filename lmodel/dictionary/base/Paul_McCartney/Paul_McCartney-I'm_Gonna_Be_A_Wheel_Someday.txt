I'm gonna be somebody;
I'm gonna be a real gone cat,
Then I won't want you.
Ev'rything gonna go my way,
I won't need nobody;
I'm gonna be a real gone cat,
Then I won't want you.
You cry and you sigh,
Girl, you wonder why
I don't look at you when you walk on by.
I'm gonna be a wheel someday,
I'm gonna be somebody;
I'm gonna be a real gone cat,
Then I won't want you-ooh.
Well, na, na, na, na, na,

Oh, you wonder why
I don't look at you when I go walkin'.
Well, I'm gonna be a wheel someday,

Then I won't want you.

Then I won't want you.
Ev'rything gonna go my way,
I won't need nobody;
I'm gonna be a real gone cat,
Then I won't want you.
You cry and you sigh,
You wonder why

I'm gonna be a wheel someday now
And I won't want you,
Babe, I won't want you.
