Recently when we were out on tour
We felt that it's okay singing
Beatles songs and stuff but it's nice to leave 'em
With a bit of a message and the world being
In a kind of state as it is these days
We choose as one of our messages ecology
Because man, if we don't sort it out, not one will
So, that's gonna be the theme of today's show
Oobu joobu, ecology
Alright, let's go straight to the sound check
And this time it's in Las Vegas
