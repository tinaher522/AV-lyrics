<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Get_Yourself_Another_Fool">
At last I wake up to see what you've done
So what can I do but pack up and runÂ ?
I know the rules, go get yourself another fool.
You said that you loved me, I 'm yours to command
But your kind of loving my heart couldn't stand
You used me for a fool, go get yourself another fool.
And now, now that we're through
You say you meant to be true
But deep in your heart, you know
That our love could never grow.
I tried to believe you that we'd never part
But your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
Now I know the rules, go get yourself another fool.
And now, now that we're through
You say you meant to be true
But deep down in your heart, you know
That our love could never grow.
Well, I tried to believe you that we'd never part
But your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
But I know the rules, go get yourself another fool, mmm
Yeah, you better get yourself, get yourself
You better get yourself another fool
Go ahead and get yourself, get yourself
Get yourself another fool, ooh.
