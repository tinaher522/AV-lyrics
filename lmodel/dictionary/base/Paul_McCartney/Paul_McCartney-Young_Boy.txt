<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Young_Boy">
He's just a young boy
Looking for a way to find love 
It isnt easy, nothing you can say
Will help him find love
Hes got to do it for himself
And it can take so long
He's just a young boy 
Looking for a way to find love
He doesnt need another helping hand from someone
But dont you think he doesnt understand what he wants 
Though independence means a lot 
He's got to still be strong
He's just a young boy 
Looking for a way to find love
Find love
A perfect combination
Find love
Whatever you do
Find love
A cause for celebration
Then it might come looking 
Come looking for you
He's just a young boy 
Looking for a way to find love
It isnt easy nothing you can say will help him find love
He's got to do it for himself 
And it can take so long
He's just a young boy 
Looking for a way to find love
Find love 
A time for meditation
Find love
A source of inspiration
Find love
Instead of confrontation
Find love
And love will come looking for you
