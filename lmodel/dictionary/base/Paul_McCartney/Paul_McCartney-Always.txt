<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Always">
Everything went wrong and the whole day long
I'd feel so blue
For the longest while I'd forget to smile
Then I met you.
Now that my blue days have passed
Now that I've found you at last.
I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always
When the things you've planned need a helping hand
I will understand always, always.
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour, not for just a day
Not for just a year but always.
Mmm, days may not be fair always
But that's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour, not for just a day
Not for just a year but always.
