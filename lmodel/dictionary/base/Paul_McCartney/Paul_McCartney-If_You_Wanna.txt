<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="If_You_Wanna">
If you wanna 
if you wanna 
if you wanna love me again 
I'll take you for a ride in my Cadillac. 
He'll be in the front, we'll be in the back 
When you're ready 
Let me know 
I'll be waiting 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip 
And if you wanna 
If you wanna, 
If you wanna do it again. 
I'll take you to the coast for a holiday 
You can be my guest 
You can let me pay-yeah 
When you're ready 
Well, let me know. 
I'll be waiting 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip 
Whenever you're ready 
When you wanna love me 
This is what you need 
To be thinking of me 
When you plant the seed of love 
When you're ready 
Let me know 
I'll be waiting 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip 
Well if you want to love me 
This is what you need 
To be thinking of me 
when you plant the seed 
the seed of love 
If you wanna 
if you wanna 
if you wanna love me again 
I'll take you for a ride in my Cadillac. 
He'll be in the front, we'll be in the back 
When you're ready 
let me know 
I'll be waiting 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip 
To make arrangements for the trip
