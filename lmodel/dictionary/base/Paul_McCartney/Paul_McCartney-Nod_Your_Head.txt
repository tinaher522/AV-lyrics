<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Nod_Your_Head">
If you really love me baby
Better than staying in bed
If you really love me baby
Nod your head
If you really love me baby
Till you fall down dead she said
If you ever want to make it
Nod your head
Nod it up
Nod it down
Side to side
Round and round
If you ever want to prove it
And you're hanging on a thread
If you ever want to shake it
Nod your head
If you think the life you're leading
Is better than the life you lead
If you like the life you're living
Well nod your head
Well nod it up
Nod it down
Side to side
Round and round
If you really love me baby
Better than staying in bed
If you really love me baby
Nod your head
