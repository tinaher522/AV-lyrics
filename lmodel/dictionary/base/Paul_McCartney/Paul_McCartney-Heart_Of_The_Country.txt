<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Heart_Of_The_Country">
I look high, I look low
I'm looking everywhere I go.
Looking for a home in the heart of the country.
A-gong go, a-gong gong
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
I'm looking for a home in the heart of the country.
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow.
Wowowoo!
I want a horse, I want a sheep
I wanna give me a good night sleep 
Living in a home in the heart of the country.
A-gong go, a-gong gong
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
I'm living in a home in the heart of the country.
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow.
Wowowoo!
I want a horse, I got a sheep
I'm gonna give me a good night sleep.
Living in a home in the heart of the country.
A-gong go, a-gong gong
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
In the heart of the country.
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow.
Wowowoo!
