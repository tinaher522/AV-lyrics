<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="I'm_Gonna_Sit_Right_Down_And_Write_Myself_A_Letter">
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom, I'll be glad I got 'em.
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you.
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe, oh I'm gonna make believe
I'm gonna make believe it came from you
