<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Get_Out_Of_My_Way">
Crash bang wallop I'm a lover again
I've got my eyes on the road
And I'm feeling no pain
I've found a real fine woman
I'm heading to see her.
Bye bye melancholy listen to me
We had a long long ride
But it isn't to be
I've found a real fine woman
I'm heading to see her.
Get out of my way
Get out of my life
I don't need anybody to tell me
How to be right
Don't try to stop me
I've got the answer
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight.
I can't help it if I'm starting to smile
I've got a full gas tank
And it's only a mile
'Till I'll bee with my little woman
I'm ready to see her.
So I say ...
Bye bye melancholy listen to me
We had a long long ride
But it isn't to be
I've found a real fine woman
I'm heading to see her.
Get out of my way
Get out of my life
I don't need anybody to tell me
How to be right
Don't try to stop me
I've got the answer
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight.
