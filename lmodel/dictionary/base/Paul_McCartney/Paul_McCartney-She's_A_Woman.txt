<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="She's_A_Woman">
My love don't give me presents 
I know that she's no peasant 
Only ever has to give me 
Love forever and forever 
My love don't give me presents 
Turns me on when I get lonely 
People tell me that she's only foolin' 
I know she isn't 
She don't give boys the eye 
She hate to see me cry 
She is happy just to hear me say 
That I will never leave her 
She don't give boys the eye 
She will never make me jealous 
Gives me all her time as well as lovin' 
Don't ask me why 
She's a woman who understands 
She's a woman who loves her man 
My love don't give me presents 
I know that she's no peasant 
Only ever has to give me 
Love forever and forever 
My love don't give me presents 
Turns me on when I get lonely 
People tell me that she's only foolin' 
I know she isn't 
She's a woman who understands 
She's a woman who loves her man 
My love don't give me presents 
I know that she's no peasant 
Only ever has to give me 
Love forever and forever 
My love don't give me presents 
Turns me on when I get lonely 
People tell me that she's only foolin' 
I know she isn't 
She's a woman, she's a woman...
