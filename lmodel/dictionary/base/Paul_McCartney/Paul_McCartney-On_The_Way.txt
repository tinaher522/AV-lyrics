1,2
1,2,3,4
Well you know I'll always love you
But it would have been a lie
If I said that I could please you
Every moment that I try
Wouldn't want to see you crying
So I hope you don't mind the things I say
On the way
Well we've been travelling for a long time
And we finally finished here
Though I said some things to hurt you
Well, it was only out of fear
Wouldn't want to see you crying
So I hope you don't mind the things I say
On the way
Well you know I’ll always love you
Everything will be alright
If I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way
Well, I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way
Well you know I’ll always love you
Everything will be ok
If I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way
