<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Day_Tripper">
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
She was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
But it took me so long to find out
And I found out
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there, now
She was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah
Tried to please her
She only plays one-night stands
Tried to please her
She only plays one-night stands, now
She was a day tripper
Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
