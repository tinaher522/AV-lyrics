<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="See_Your_Sunshine">
She makes me feel glad
I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why
I'm not going to lie
I'll have to say that I adore her
Look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine
Step out in front of me baby
They want you in the front line
They want to see your sun shine
She picks up daisies from a field
She loves to weave them in her hair
And though she knows it isn't real
She still hears music in the air
It's coming from inside her heart
I hope it lasts forever
The sun is shining in her sky
She wants to dance around the world
And though I'd love to be the guy
That gets to walk off with the girl
I'll go along with all she needs 
And it will be my pleasure
Look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine
Step out in front of me baby
They want you in the front line
They want to see your sun shine
She makes me feel glad
I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why
I'm not going to lie
I'll have to say that I adore her
Look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine
I want to see your sunshine
