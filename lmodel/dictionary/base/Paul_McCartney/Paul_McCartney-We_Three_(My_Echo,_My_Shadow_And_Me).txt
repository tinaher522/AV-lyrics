<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="We_Three_(My_Echo,_My_Shadow_And_Me)">
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me
We three we're not a crowd, we're not even company
My echo, my shadow and me.
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight that shines above ?
I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo but where's the one I love ?
We three, we'll wait for you, even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me.
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me.
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight that shines above ?
I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo but where's the one I love ?
We three, we'll wait for you, even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me, we'll be waiting
My echo, my shadow and me.
