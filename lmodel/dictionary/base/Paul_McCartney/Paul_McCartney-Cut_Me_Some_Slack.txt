<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Cut_Me_Some_Slack">
Dear mama, set me free
Hey mama, let me be
Mama, watch me run
Mama, I wanna have some fun (yeah)
Hey mama, let me down
I said mother, I want to go to town
If you want me to stick around I want to give em some slack
I'm gonna hear the woman yet never come back
If you want (me) to stick around you've got to cut me some slack
I want to hear the woman yet never come back
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Mama, let me be
Oh now mother, set me free
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon watch me run
Oh, Mama, I just want to have some fun
Oh, set me free
Set me free
