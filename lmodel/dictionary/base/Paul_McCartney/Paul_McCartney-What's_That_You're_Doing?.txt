<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="What's_That_You're_Doing?">
(Good morning)
(Or good afternoon)
(Good night)
What's that you're doing?
Girl, I like what you do to me 
What's that you're doing?
'Cause it makes no kind of sense to me
You can me me feel so proud
You can make me holler, ow!
Girl, you make me wanna dance and sing
My mind is blown and you're the blame
I say it's sunnin' where there's rain
I know by leaps and bounds, just call my name
What's that you're saying?
Girl, I like the way you talk to me
What's that you're saying?
Even if it's wrong, girl, I do agree
Girl, you make me feel so small
Though I might stand six feet tall
What you've got cuts me right down to size
I'll be the last, you be the first
I'll do my betst to quench your thirst
I'm the lucky one who keeps the prize
Girl I like what you're doing (girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do some more (baby, do it some more)
Girl I like what you're doing (girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do some more
Girl, I like what you
Do to me, do to me
Do It Some More 
Do To Me, Do To Me 
Do It Some More 
You know that I appreciate what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
Girl, I like what you do to me 
What's that you're doing?
'Cause it makes no kind of sense to me
You can fill my appetite
Without me taking up a bite
Never never knoew that love could fill you up
You're much too good for me to pass
I'm for the taking, you just ask
We can make it stick with love and luck
Girl I like what you're doing (girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do some more (baby, do it some more)
Girl I like what you're doing (girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do some more
Girl I Like What You 
Do To Me, Do To Me 
Do It Some More 
You Know I Like What You're Doing 
Girl I Like What You're Doing 
Baby Do It Some More 
What's that' I'm feeling?
That sensation's such an mystery
I know what, it's thrilling
And I hope this feeling lasts eternally
Girl, you make me scream and shout
Tell me what it's all about
You make me give in without a fight, yeah
I don't have no words to say
You can fill it anyway
And everything you do will turn out alright, right, right
Girl I like what you're doing (girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do some more (baby, do it some more)
Girl I like what you're doing (girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do some more (baby, do it some more)
 
She Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah 
She Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
Girl I like what you're doing (girl, I like what you're doing)
When it's one o'clock, when it's two o' clock
