<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Driving_Rain">
One, two, three, four, five, Let's go for a drive
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, Let's go there and back again, oohh
Somethings open an it's my heart
Somethings missing it's when, apart
Somethings good it's when were, back together again
A Nothing's wrong it's just insane
Nothing's right until your, back again
Nothing's broken when it's, softly spoken 
And, walkin slowly down the lane
Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight throught eye of the hurricane
Go a ride in the driving rain
One, two, three, four, five, Let's go for a drive
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, oohhew
One, two, three, four, five, Let's go for a drive
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Ya let's go there and back again, baby, baby
You come walkin through my door
Like the one that I've been waiting for
Letting sunshine in the darkest place when
I've been going back there again
So why don't we drive in the rain
Straight throught eye of the hurricane
Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight throught eye of the hurricane
Go a ride in the driving rain
One, two, three, four, five, Let's go for a drive
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, oohhew
One, two, three, four, five, Let's go for a drive
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Let's go there and back again, baby, baby
oh the Driving Rain
Why do we drive in the driving rain
One, two, three, four, five, oohh
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, oh let's go back again
One, two, three, four, five, Let's go for a drive
Aj Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, oh let's go back again
Who come walkin through my door
Like the one that I've been waiting for
