<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="The_Song_We_Were_Singing">
For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intracacies of life
We could jaw, through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah
But we always came back to the song
We were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
We were singing  
At any particular time
Take a sip, see the world through a glass 
And speculate about the cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philisophical discussion
Oh yeah
But we always came back to the song
We were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
We were singing  
At any particular time
For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intracacies of life
We could jaw, through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah
But we always came back to the song
We were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
We were singing  
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back
Take a sip, see the world through a glass 
And speculate about the cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philisophical discussion
Oh yeah
But we always came back to the song
We were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
We were singing  
At any particular time
Yeah
We always came back to the song we were singing
