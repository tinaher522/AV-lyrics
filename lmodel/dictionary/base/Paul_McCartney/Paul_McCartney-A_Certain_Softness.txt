<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="A_Certain_Softness">
A certain softness in her eyes fascinates me
More than I ever thought it would (A certain softness)
More than I ever thought it could
A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
A kind of sadness in her smile captivates me
Surer than anything that's sure (A kind of sadness)
Surer than anything before
A kind of sadness in her smile
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
If even can even find the words to tell
I wouldn't want to anyway
'Cause that would only break the spell
And you know very well I couldn't betray her
The touch of wildness in her style haunts my memory
More than I ever thought it would (A touch of wildness)
More than I ever thought it could
A touch of wildness in her style
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
A certain softness in her eyes fascinates me
More than I ever thought it would (A certain softness)
More than I ever thought it could
A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
