<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Highway">
Running through the night time, baby, looking like a wreck
Got too many highlights with a lovelight on her neck
Lookin' for some paydirt that'll maybe come around
Everybody wonderin' what's that soundÂ ?
Highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  move me  (do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  always  (do ya, do ya, do ya)
Standing in the doorway of a little black shop
Lifting off the penknife and a-ringin' up the cops
Running down the street, everybody sees
What she's got is what she needs and what she loves is me.
Highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  baby  (do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  play dead  (do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  who's making you follow  (do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  lose me in the hollow  (do ya, do ya, do ya).
Lose me tomorrow
Every night and every hour
Take me higher every day
Move me, baby, move me
Everybody wonders why you're lookin' such a wreck, yeah.
Down the highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  liftin' up your penknife  (do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway  (do ya, do ya, do ya)  lookin' for some paydirt  (do ya, do ya, do ya)
Everybody wonders why you didn't mind the store
They don't know what you're sellin', no
Somebody can move me, oh, I feel it shakin'.
Words are gettin' higher
Everybody fire
Oh, the sun is risin' again.
Words are gettin' higher
Everybody fire
Oh, the sun is risin' again.
Words are gettin' higher
Everybody fire
Oh, the sun is risin' again.
Words are gettin' higher
Everybody fire
Oh, the sun is risin' again.
Hey now, baby, what you doin', I'll be coming
Never mind the highway, I'll be runnin', runnin', runnin'.
