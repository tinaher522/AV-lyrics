<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Baby's_Request">
When the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the stars settle down for a rest
Just do me one small favour, I beg you
Please play me my baby's request
It's the song that we heard when we started
Now the birds have all flown from our nest
But you could bring back memories departed
By playing my baby's request
My baby said that she knows how it goes
But you're the one who really knows
So go ahead
Just one more time and then we'll go to bed
But you could bring back memories departed
By playing my baby's request
My baby said that she knows how it goes
But you're the one who really knows
So go ahead
Just one more time and then we'll go to bed
When the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the stars settle down for a rest
Just do me one small favour, I beg you
Please play me my baby's requestk
Mh-hm, play me baby's request
Please! Play me my baby's request
One more time
