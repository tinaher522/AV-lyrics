We're Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
We hope that you've enjoyed the show!
We're Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
We're sorry but it's time to go!
Seargent Pepper's Lonely, Seargent Pepper's Lonely, Seargent Pepper's Lonely, Seargent Pepper's Lonely...
We're Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
We'd like to thank you once again!
We're Seargent Pepper's One and Only Lonely Hearts Club Band,
It's getting very near the end!
Seargent Pepper's Lonely, Seargent Pepper's Loenly, Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Oh yeah! All Right!
Are you're gonna be in my dreams tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you.
And in the end: The love you take, is equal to the love you make!
