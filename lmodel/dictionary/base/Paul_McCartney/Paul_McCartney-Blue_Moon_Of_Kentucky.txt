<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Blue_Moon_Of_Kentucky">
Well Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining,
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining,
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
Well, it was on one moonlight night,
Well Stars shining bright,
Wind blowin' high
My Love said good-bye.
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining.
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
Well, it was on one moonlight night,
Stars shining bright,
Wind blowin' high
Love said good-bye.
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining.
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
Well Blue moon, blue moon, blue moon,
Keep shining bright.
Well Blue moon, keep on shining bright,
You're gonna bring me back my baby tonight,
Blue moon, yeh keep shining bright.
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining,
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining,
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
Well, it was on one moonlight night,
Stars shining bright,
Wind blowin' high
My Love said good-bye.
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining.
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
