<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Pretty_Little_Head">
Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen. 
Oh, oh. oh, oh. 
Hillmen come down from the lava. 
Forging across the mighty river flow. oh, oh. 
Always forever, only so you don't worry 
Your pretty little head. 
Ursa Major...Ursa Major...
Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen. 
Oh, oh. oh, oh. 
Hillmen bring garments, spices. 
Carrying trinkets, slik and precious stones. oh, oh. 
Exotic legends, 
Only so you don't worry 
Your pretty little head. 
Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen. 
Oh, oh. oh, oh. 
Hillmen are sworn to allegiance. 
Living a life of silent dignity. oh, oh. 
For your protection, 
Only so you don't worry 
Your pretty little head. 
Ursa Major...Ursa Major...
The hillman...
Living in the higher reaches.
