<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Ac-cent-tchu-ate_The_Positive">
You got to accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in-between.
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene.
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale and Noah in the ark
What did they do just when everything seemed so dark ?
Man, they said, we better ..
Accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween
Liable to walk upon the scene.
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale and Noah in the ark
What did they do just when everything seemed so dark ?
Man, they said, we better ..
Accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in-between
Oh no,
Too dark for you
Don't mess with mister in-between
