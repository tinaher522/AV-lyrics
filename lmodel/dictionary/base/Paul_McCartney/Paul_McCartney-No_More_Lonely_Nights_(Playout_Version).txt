<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="No_More_Lonely_Nights_(Playout_Version)">
I Can Wait Another Day Until I Call You 
You've Only Got My Heart On A String And Everything A Flutter 
But Another Lonely Night (And Another, And Another) 
Might Take Forever(And Another, And Another) 
We've Only Got Each Other To Blame 
It's All The Same To Me Love 
'Cause I Know What I Feel To Be Right 
No More Lonely Nights 
No More Lonely Nights 
You're My Guiding Light 
Day Or Night I'm Always There 
May I Never Miss The Thrill Of Being Near You 
And If It Takes A Couple Of Years 
To Turn Your Tears To Laughter 
I Will Do What I Feel To Be Right 
No More Lonely Nights 
Never Be Another 
No More Lonely Nights 
You're My Guiding Light 
Day Or Night I'm Always There 
And I Won't Go Away Until You Tell Me So 
No I'll Never Go Away 
Yes I Know What I Feel To Be Right 
No More Lonely Nights 
Never Be Another 
No More Lonely Nights 
You're My Guiding Light 
Day Or Night I'm Always There 
And I Won't Go Away Until You Tell Me So 
No I'll Never Go Away 
I Won't Go Away Until You Tell Me So 
No I'll Never Go Away 
No More Lonely Nights, No No ...
