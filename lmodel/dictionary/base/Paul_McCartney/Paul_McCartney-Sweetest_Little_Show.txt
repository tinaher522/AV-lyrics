<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Sweetest_Little_Show">
Well, they can treat you like a brother
Yeah, they can treat you like a clown
But if they treat you like a lover
They've got the sweetest little show in town
You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town
You've been around a long time
But you're still good for a while
And if they try to criticize you
Make them smile, make them smile
And if they treat you like a brother
Well you will never, never let them down
But if they treat you like a lover
They've got the sweetest little show in town
They got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town
You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town
You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Ah, ba da, ba
