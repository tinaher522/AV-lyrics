<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Eleanor_Rigby">
Ah, look at all the lonely people 
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice 
In the church where her wedding has been, 
Lives in a dream. 
Waits at the window,
Wearing the face that she keeps
In a jar by the door, 
Who is it for? 
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ? 
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ? 
Father Mackenzie, writing the words to a sermon
That no one will hear, 
No one comes near. 
Look at him working,
Darning his socks 
In the night when there's nobody there 
What does he care ? 
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ? 
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ? 
Ah, look at all the lonely people 
Ah, look at all the lonely people 
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name 
Nobody came. 
Father Mackenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands 
As he walks from the grave 
No one was saved. 
All the lonely people, where do they all come from? 
(ah, look at all the lonely people) 
All the lonely people, where do they all belong? 
(ah, look at all the lonely people)
