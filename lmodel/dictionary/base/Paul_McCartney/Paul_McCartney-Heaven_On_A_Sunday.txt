<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Heaven_On_A_Sunday">
Peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love,
But it's a dream we're going through
And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I choose
Restful, like Devon on a Monday 
Cooling, my finger in the bay
We've been learning a song
But it's a long and lonely blues
And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
It's peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love
But it's a dream, we're going through
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
You'd be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
You'd be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love
