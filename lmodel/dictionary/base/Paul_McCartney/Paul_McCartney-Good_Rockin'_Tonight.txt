<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Good_Rockin'_Tonight">
Well, I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight. 
Well, I heard the news 
Ev'rybody rocking tonight. 
I say, well, why don't you meet me behind the barn, 
Don't you be worried, I'll do you no harm 
I want you to bring along my rockin' shoes, 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all my blues. 
I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight. 
Well, gonna rock, gonna rock, 
Gonna rock, yeh gonna rock. 
Gonna rock all our blues away. 
Well, I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight. 
Well, I heard the news Ev'rybody rocking tonight. 
I say, well, why don't you meet me behind the barn, 
Don't you be worried I'll do you no harm 
I want you to bring along my rockin' shoes, 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all my blues. 
I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight. 
Well, gonna rock, gonna rock, 
Gonna rock, yeh gonna rock. 
Gonna rock all our blues away. 
Yeh, we're gonna rock, 
Gonna rock, let's rock, 
Ah Rock, gonna rock all our blues away. 
Well, I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight. 
Well, I heard the news Ev'rybody rocking tonight. 
I say, well, why don't you meet me behind the barn, 
Don't you be worried I'll do you no harm 
I want you to bring along my rockin' shoes, 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all my blues. 
I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight. 
Well, gonna rock, gonna rock, 
Gonna rock, yeh gonna rock. 
Gonna rock all our blues away. 
Yeh, we're gonna rock, 
Gonna rock, let's rock, 
Ah Rock, 
Gonna rock all our blues away.
