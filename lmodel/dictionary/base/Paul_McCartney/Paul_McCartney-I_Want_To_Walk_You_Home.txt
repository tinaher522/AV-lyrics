<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="I_Want_To_Walk_You_Home">
I want to walk you home
Please let me walk you home
I want to walk you home
Please let me walk you home
You look so good to me ooh ooh wee
I wish I was the lucky guy
Who could walk you right on down the aisle
I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I'm not trying to be smart
I'm not trying to break your heart
But if I ask you for a date
Will you tell me that I'm not too late
I want to hold your hand
Please let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
Yeah, please let me hold your hand
You look so good to me ooh ooh wee
I saw you walking all alone
That's why I wanna walk you home

So let me walk you home
Please let me walk you home
I wanna walk you home
Oh baby, let me walk you home
Well, you look so good to me ooh ooh wee
I'm not trying to be smart
And I love the way you talk
I wanna hold your hand
So let me hold your hand
And let me walk you home
Oh baby, I want to walk you home
Oh you look so good to me baby
All I want to do is walk you home
Let me walk you home baby
Yeah we could walk and talk
Uh hmmm I'm not tryin' to be smart
I just wanna walk you home
