<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Appreciate">
Lift up your head and remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away
When you're left for dead in the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day.
There's something there but you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away
Show that you care and be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day.
She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love, oh yeah
She says it's all a show and no-go, you drop everything
Give back, reciprocate her love.
Lift up your head and remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away
When you're left for dead in the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day.
She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love, oh yeah
She says it's all a show and no-go, you drop everything
Give back, reciprocate her love.
There's something there but you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away
Show that you care and be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day.
