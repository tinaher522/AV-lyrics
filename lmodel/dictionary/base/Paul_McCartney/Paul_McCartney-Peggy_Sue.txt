<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Peggy_Sue">
Peggy Sue, oh how my heart yearns for you
Oh, oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue, ooo, ooo..
Well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
Oh, if you knew, Peggy Sue
Oh, my heart yearns for you, 
Oh, oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue, ooo, ooo..
Well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
Do, do, do, do, do
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, P
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue
Oh, oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue, ooo, ooo..
Well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
