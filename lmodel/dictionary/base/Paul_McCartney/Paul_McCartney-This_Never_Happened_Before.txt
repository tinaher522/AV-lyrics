<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="This_Never_Happened_Before">
I'm very sure this never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before
Now I see this is the way it's supposed to be
I met you and now I see
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be
For lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own
So come to me
Now we can be what we want to be
I love you and now I see
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be
For lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own
I'm very sure this never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)
