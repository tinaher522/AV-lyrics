<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Broadcast">
We've got a chance and we'll take it; 
We may win or we may lose; 
We may even have to cut and run for it. 
Well, it won't be the first time I've run 
And it won't be the first time I've been caught. 
It's the game that matters. 
Brother, I am proud to know you. 
This is one of the greatest moments I have ever experienced. 
I think I'll sense a situation when we all esteemed it 
An honor to breathe the rather inferior atmosphere 
Of this station here along with our little friend. 
I guess we should all go home and treasure the memory of his face 
As the whitest thing in our museum of recollection. 
And, perhaps, this good woman will also go home 
And watch the face of our little brother here. 
I'm inspired with a new faith in mankind. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to present to you 
A sure enough saint who only wants a halo to be transfixed. 
Stand right up.
