I Want You To Fly
I want you to fly
I want you to grow
I like you to get back
Whatever you lose
I want you to learn
What you wanna know
I like you to follow
The road that you choose
Ooh at the same time
I wanna hold on
Don't want you to go
I like to be near you
Whatever you do
I want us to hide (Ooh)
I want to let low (Ooh)
Doesn't make sense but (Ooh)
I wanna be you (Ooh)
I wanna be you (At the)
I want to be you (Same)
I want to be you (Time)
I wanna be you (At)
I wanna be you (The)
I wanna be you (Same)
I (Time)
I want us to hide
I want to let low
But doens't make sense but
I wanna be you
I want you to fly
So the cages open now
We take him fly to
Rising and falling like snow
In the nights
I'm feeling while a windy scene
Between my palms
I got my hands and the bird
Flies out
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
So the cages open now (Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We take him fly to
Rising and falling like snow
In the nights
Rising and falling like snow
In the nights
