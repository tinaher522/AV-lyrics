I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh, I saw the photograph.
 
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.
 
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look, having read the book
I'd love to turn you on.
 
Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat, got the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.
 
Aaah...
All we are saying is give peace a chance
Yeah, all we are saying is give peace a chance.
All we are saying, everybody say, is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance.
[All we are saying is give peace a chance]
[All we are saying is give peace a chance]
[All we are saying is give peace a chance]
[All we are saying is give peace a chance]
All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance, oh yeah yeah
All we are saying, oh yeah yeah, is give peace a chance.
