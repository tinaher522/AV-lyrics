<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Back_On_My_Feet">
How many days will the wet weather last? 
I want know will the clouds, when they roll back 
Reveal a man in an old mac 
Living on a park bench, 
Sitting on his own? 
Cut the rain as it runs down the glass 
Eventually through the lightning and thunder 
We see a man going under 
This is how it happens 
This is what he said 
I don't need love though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 'til I'm back on me feet 
You're always telling me about my misery 
I've seen things you will never see 
Don't pity me 
Focus in on the breath of a man 
Who takes a brown paper bag from his knapsack 
Between his whispers and wise cracks 
He's looking for permission 
Screaming at the sky 
I don't need love though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 'til I'm back on me feet 
You're always telling me about my misery 
I've seen things you will never see 
Don't pity me 
I'll be right again, be upright without you 
I'll stand up again, kick up a fuss again too 
Cut back again to a girl walking by 
Until the feet that are all shoes and no socks 
Climb an invisible soap box 
Laughing at the traffic 
Shouting at the world 
I don't need love (I don't need love) though temptation is sweet (oh, so sweet)
Give me your hand 'til I'm back on my feet (yeah, back on my feet)
You're always telling me (you're always telling me) about my misery 
I've seen things you will never see 
Don't pity me 
I'll stand up again, kick up a fuss again too 
I'll be right again, be upright without you 
(We see a life through the eyes of a man 
As he lives and he dies by a simple tattoo)
I'll be back again when I land on my feet 
I'll stand up again, kick up a fuss again - wouldn't you?
(Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him 
It's there on his face; he's a case where there's clearly no hope)
Give me your hand again 'til I land again 
(His face starts to fade as we pull down the shade 
And the picture we made is in glorious Cinemascope) 
I'll be back, I'll be back...
I'll be back...
