<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="Something">
Something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she wo--os me
I don't want to leave her now, you know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows, that I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now, you know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow,
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show,
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows, and all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now, you know I believe and how
