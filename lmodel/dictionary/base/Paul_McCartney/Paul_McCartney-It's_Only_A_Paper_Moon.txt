<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="It's_Only_A_Paper_Moon">
Said it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn’t be make believe
If you believed in me
Say it is only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn’t be make believe
If you believed in me
Without your love, it’s a honky-tonk parade
Without your love, it’s a melody played in a penny arcade
It’s a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn’t be make believe
If you believed in me
Without your love, it’s a honky-tonk parade
Without your love, it’s a melody played in a penny arcade
Yes, it’s a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn’t be make believe
If you believed in me
If you believed in me
If you believed in me
