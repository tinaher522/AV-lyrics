<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="I_Owe_It_All_To_You">
Last night you helped me through,
Took me to the lover zone.
I saw there, images
Projected on a wall of stone.
I stood inside Egyptian temples,
I looked into eternal gardens, 
Lay on the shores of distant islands,
Listening to the sea birds song of joy.
Oh - I owe it all to you,
You make me happy,
Oh - I owe it all to you.
Last night, we were right
Into some exotic scene.
Everywhere, images
Appearing on a gigant screen.
I stood inside a glass cathedral,
I looked into the golden canyon,
Lay by the lakes of holy water
Glistening lika a diamond in the light.
Oh - I owe it all to you,
You make me happy,
Oh - I owe it all to you.
