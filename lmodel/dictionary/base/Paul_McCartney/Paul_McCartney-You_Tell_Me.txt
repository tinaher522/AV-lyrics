<song artist="Paul_McCartney" title="You_Tell_Me">
When was that summer when the skies were blue?
The bright red cardinal flew down from his tree
You tell me
When was that summer when it never rained?
The air was buzzing with the sweet old honey bee
Let's see
You tell me
Were we there, was it real?
Is it truly how I feel?
Maybe
You tell me
Were we there, is it true?
Was I really there with you?
Let's see
You tell me
When was that summer of a dozen words?
The butterflies and hummingbirds flew free
Let's see
You tell me
Let's see
You tell me
