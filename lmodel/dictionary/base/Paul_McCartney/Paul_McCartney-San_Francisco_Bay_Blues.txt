Ow! Ow!
Well, when I'm walking with my baby
Down by the San Francisco bay,
The ocean liner is going so far away,
I didn't mean to treat her so bad,
She was the best pal I ever had.
She made me cry, she made me sigh,
I wanna lay down and die.
Well, I ain't got a dollar, I don't give a lousy dime,
And if she never comes back, you know, I'm gonna lose my mind.
But if she ever come back to stay, it's gonna be a brand new day,
When I'm walking with my baby
Down by the San Francisco bay, hey, yeah.
Yihay!
Yihay!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh yeah, I don't give a lousy dime!
Gonna lose my mind!
But if she ever...
Yes, it's gonna be a...
Walking...
Yeah, yeah.
Well, when I'm walking with my baby
Down by the San Francisco bay,
You know the ocean liner is going so far away,
Well, I didn't mean to treat her so bad,
She was the best pal I ever had.
She made me cry, she made me sigh,
She made me wanna lay down and die.
