<song artist="Maroon_5" title="New_Love">
I'll be a sun, a moon, a night
Yeah, I can be whatever you like, wooh
I was alone but I'm ready to feel
I want to show you my feelings are real, yeah
All this time I've been leaving it up
Every night I'd been falling in love, wooh
But I'm finally seeing the light
Falling in love with you every night, yeah
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me, now?
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?
What the fuck, I got nothing to lose
I'm a slave to the way that you move, wooh
I'm an addict for all that you do
You're the only drug I wanna do, yeah
I can tell that you need my love
And all I want is to give it to you, wooh
Don't give up on the moment tonight
You'll regret it, just thinking life, yeah
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me, now?
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?
I still don't care
Cause if you don't know it yet
You'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy, yeah
Cause I know I lie
And it wouldn't kill you child
Won't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me
Till you forgiven me, forgiven me
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me, now?
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?
