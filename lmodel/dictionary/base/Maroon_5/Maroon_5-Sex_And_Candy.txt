<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Sex_And_Candy">
Hanging 'round downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And then there she was like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was like disco Super Fly
I smell sex and candy here, mmm-hmm
Who's that loungin' in my chair? Mmm-hmm
Who's that castin' devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, dig it
Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I've had too much caffeine and I was thinkin' 'bout myself
And then there she was in platform double suede
Yeah, there she was like disco lemonade
I smell sex and candy here, mmm-hmm
Who's that loungin' in my chair? Mmm-hmm
Who's that castin' devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, dig it
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
I smell sex and candy here, mmm-hmm
Who's that loungin' in my chair? Mmm-hmm
Who's that castin' devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this must be my dream
