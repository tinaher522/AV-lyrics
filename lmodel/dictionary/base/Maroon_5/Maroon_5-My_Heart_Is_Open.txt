<song artist="Maroon_5" title="My_Heart_Is_Open">
I know you're scared, oh I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that too
But take a chance on me, you won't regret it, no
One more no and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me
It won't take me long to find another lover but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you
You don't ever to say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Want to hear you say, yeah yeah yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you've got to say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Want to hear you say, yeah yeah yeah
Want to hear you say, want to hear you say, want to hear you say
Yes yes yes yes yes yeah, yes yes yes yes yes
It's just a moment, go and seize it
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if you do I know that I won't let you down, no
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
Cause I can't breathe until I see your face
Oh and I don't need time to find another lover but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you
You don't ever to say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Want to hear you say, yeah yeah yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you've got to say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Want to hear you say, yeah yeah yeah
Want to hear you say, want to hear you say, want to hear you say
Yes yes yes yes yes yeah
