<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Unkiss_Me">
If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me, I can handle it
Stop pretending, cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending kind of run around
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it
You cannot have fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't want to
Don't act like I mean nothing
If you're gonna then you better
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start
Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can handle it
I just feel it, that you're over us
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces cause you're over us
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it
You cannot have fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't want to
Don't act like I mean nothing
If you're gonna, well then you better
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, yeah yeah
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start
So unkiss me, unkiss me, yeah
So baby let go, got to let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending kind of run around
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, oh no no no
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start, yeah
So unkiss me, so unkiss me, yeah
Unkiss me
