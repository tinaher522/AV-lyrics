<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Sunday_Morning">
Yeah...
Sunday morning rain is falling 
Steal some covers, share some skin 
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable 
You twist to fit the mold that I am in 
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do 
And I would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you 
That someday it would lead me back to you 
That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 
Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
Paint a picture with my hands 
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm 
Change the weather, still together when it ends 
That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 
Yeah!
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
You may not know
That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah...
I'm a flower in your hair, I'm a flower in your hair
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah...
Get back here
Get back here, yeah...
