<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Sweetest_Goodbye">
Where you are seems to be as far as an eternity 
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start? 
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind 
I know you understand 
And with a tear in my eye 
Give me the sweetest goodbye 
That I ever did receive 
Pushing forward and arching back 
Bring me closer to heart attack 
Say goodbye and just fly away 
When you come back, I have something to say 
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone 
When you get home? 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go 
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday 
Try so hard to disregard 
The rhythm of the rain that drops 
And coincides with the beating of my heart 
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind 
And I know you understand 
And with a tear in my eye 
Give me the sweetest goodbye 
That I ever, ever, ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back 
Bring me closer to heart attack 
Say goodbye and just fly away 
When you come back, I have something to say 
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone 
When you get home? 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go 
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
Pushing forward and arching back 
Bring me closer to heart attack 
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone 
When you get home? 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go 
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go 
So I can show you how I feel...
