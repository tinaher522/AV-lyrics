<song artist="Maroon_5" title="The_Sentimental_Programmer">
I'm a sentimental programmer
And I'm mixed up with an almost girl
[ ] and fed
Prime cuts of leg
Needle in vest
Thoughts in her head
I tired of the waiting line
So I built a girl and made her mine
Passes the best replica test
Needle in vest
Thoughts in her head
Twist a photographic model cast in plastic
Works so well she seems iconoclastic
Similar make up
I'm stuck in a low rut
I wanna try something new
And all that I wanted was formula bonded
And all I was missing was you
I'm crippled with a human mind
So I'm dreaming of the android kind
[ ] and fed
Prime cuts of leg
Needle in vest
Thoughts in her head
Twist a photographic model cast in plastic
Works so well she seems iconoclastic
Similar make up
I'm stuck in a low rut
I wanna try something new
And all that I wanted was formula bonded
And all that I'm missing is you
