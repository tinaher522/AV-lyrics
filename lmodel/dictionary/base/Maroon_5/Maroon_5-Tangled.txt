<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Tangled">
I'm full of regret 
For all the things that I have done and said 
And I don't know
If it'll ever be okay to show 
My face around here 
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear 
Would you ever turn your head and look?
See if I'm gone 
'Cause I fear there is nothing left to say 
To you, that you wanna hear 
That you wanna know 
I think I should go 
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
You're just an innocent 
A helpless victim of a spider's web 
And I'm an insect 
Going after anything that I can get 
So you better turn your head and run 
And don't look back 
'Cause I fear there is nothing left to say 
To you, that you wanna hear 
That you wanna know 
I think I should go 
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
And I've done you so wrong 
Treated you bad, strung you along 
Oh, shame on myself 
I don't know how I got so tangled up 
Mm, oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
You better turn your head and look 
See if I'm gone 
'Cause I fear there is nothing left to say 
To you, that you wanna hear 
That you wanna know 
I think I should go 
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
And I've done you so wrong 
Treated you bad, strung you along 
Oh, shame on myself 
I don't know how I got so tangled up 
Yeah, tangled, mm...
I've done you so wrong 
Treated you bad, strung you along 
Oh, shame on myself 
I don't know how I got so tangled up
