<song artist="Maroon_5" title="In_Your_Pocket">
Say, what you mad at me for, me for?
Yeah, why you talk that evil? Yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no
Say, what you crying to me for, me for?
Trying to control your ego, yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no
Cause I got all the things I want to say but nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you and never ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know, this is really all about?
It should be really easy if you have nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So what you spying on me for, me for?
Tell me what you're looking for
That shit you saying is so low, so low
No love, no love, no no
But tell me where that you go, you go when
You say you need time alone, yeah
You really think I don't know, don't know
I know, I know, I know
Cause I got all the things I want to say but nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you and never ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know, this is really all about?
It should be really easy if you have nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
Show me yours, I'll show you mine, I-I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine, I-I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine, I-I'll show you mine
I-I'll show you mine
Yeah, I can't believe you looked me in the eye
And said to me you had nothing to hide
Yeah, now you're dead to me, this really is goodbye
Goodbye
Cause I got all the things I want to say but nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you and never ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know, this is really all about?
It should be really easy if you have nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
Show me yours, I'll show you mine, I-I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine, I-I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine, I-I'll show you mine
Show me that phone in your pocket
