<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Never_Gonna_Leave_This_Bed">
You push me, I don't have the strength to resist or control you 
So take me down, take me down 
You hurt me, but do I deserve this? 
You make me so nervous 
Calm me down 
Calm me down
Wake you up, in the middle of the night to say 
I will never walk away again 
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So come here and never leave this place 
Perfection of your face 
Slows me down 
Slows me down
So fall down 
I need you to trust me 
Go easy don't rush me 
Help me out why don't you help me out
Wake you up, in the middle of the night to say 
I will never walk away again 
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So, you say go, it isn't working and I say no, it isn't perfect so I'll stay instead 
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it take it all, take all that I have 
I'd give it all away just to get you back 
And fake it fake it I'll take what I can get 
Knocking so loud can you hear me yet 
Try to stay away but you can't forget
Wake you up, in the middle of the night to say 
I will never walk away again 
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So, you say go, it isn't working and I say no, it isn't perfect so I'll stay instead 
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it take it all take all that I have
