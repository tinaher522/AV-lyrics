<song artist="Maroon_5" title="If_I_Fell">
If I fell in love with you 
Would you promise to be true 
And help me understand 
'Cause I've been in love before 
And I've found that love was more 
Than just holding hands 
If I give my heart to you 
I must be sure from the very start 
That you would love me more than her 
If I trust in you 
Oh now please, don't run and hide 
If I love you, too 
Oh please, don't hurt my pride like her 
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain 
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain 
So I hope you'll see 
That I would love to love you 
And that she will cry 
When she learns we are two 
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain 
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain 
So I hope you'll see 
That I would love to love you 
And that she will cry 
When she learns we are two 
If I fell in love with you, yeah
