<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Hands_All_Over">
Put your hands all over 
Put your hands all over me 
Put your hands all over 
Put your hands all over me (put your hands all over me) 
I can't seem to find 
The pretty little face I left behind 
That Wandered out on the open road 
Looking for a better place to call home 
Gave her a place to stay 
And she got up and ran away 
And now I have had enough 
Her pretty little face has torn me up 
Put your hands all over me 
Please talk to me, talk to me 
Tell me everything is gonna be alright 
Put your hands all over me 
Please walk with me, walk with me now 
Love is a game, you say 
Play me and put me away 
(Put your hands all over me, Ohh Ohh)
Now you've lost your mind 
The pretty little girl I left behind 
And now you're getting rough 
But everybody knows you're not that tough 
She wandered out on the open road 
Lookin' for a place to call your own 
You're scared to death of the road ahead 
Pretty little thing don't get upset 
Put your hands all over me 
Please talk to me, talk to me 
Tell me everything is gonna be alright (s'gonna be alright) 
Put your hands all over me 
Please walk with me, walk with me now 
Love is a game, you say, play me and put me away 
Love is a game, you say, play me and put me away 
Put your hands all over me, (ooohooo,hoo)
Put your hands all over me, yeah yeah yeah, yeah 
Put your hands all over me, ooh (All over me) 
So come down off your cloud 
Say it now and say it loud 
Get up in my face 
Pretty little girl, come make my day 
Put your hands all over me 
Please talk to me, talk to me girl (oh)
Put your hands all over me 
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now (come on) 
Put your hands all over me 
Gotta talk to me, talk to me (come on now, babe) 
Put your hands all over me (woo) 
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now 
Love is a game, you say, play me and put me away 
Love is a game, you say, play me and put me away 
(Put your hands all over me) 
Yeah (All over me) 
(Put your hands)
Put your hands (all over) all over 
Put your hands all over me
