<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Wasted_Years">
Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standing right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
Kinda driving her crazy
I know she wants me
I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugarcane
And sit on top of me, yelling out my f name
Until I'm empty
I know she wants me
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya
Cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax 
You know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Cause sometimes I don't know what to do 
I'm scared and standing right in front of you
And pray our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact you may just want to run away
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh
Deep down you know that
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
I've already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
