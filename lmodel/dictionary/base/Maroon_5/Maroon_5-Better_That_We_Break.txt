<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Better_That_We_Break">
I never knew perfection till I heard you speak 
And now it kills me just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do, sleeping's impossible too
And everything's reminding me of you
What can I do?
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there it disappears
It disappears
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
Saw you sitting all alone
You're fragile and you're cold, but that's alright
Love these days is getting rough
It knocks you down, then beats you up
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, and I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break, baby
