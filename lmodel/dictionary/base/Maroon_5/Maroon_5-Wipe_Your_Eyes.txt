<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Wipe_Your_Eyes">
I’m afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go where you gonna go
We gotta make it change time to turn the page
Something isn’t right I don’t wanna fight you
We’ve been through tougher times you know it gets worse
We can’t turn this around please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn’t right I don’t wanna fight you
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I’m causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I’m here to wipe your eyes
Tonight before you fall asleep
I’ll run my thumb across your cheek
Cry, ’cause I’m here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You got to breathe we’ll be okay
Cry, ’cause I’m here to wipe your eyes
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah
‘Cause I’m here to wipe your eyes
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah
When do we cross the line
How could we forget
Why do we let the pressure get into our heads
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
‘Cause something isn't right, I don’t wanna fight
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I’m causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I’m here to wipe your eyes
Tonight before you fall asleep
I’ll run my thumb across your cheek
Cry, ’cause I’m here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You got to breathe we’ll be okay
Cry, ’cause I’m here to wipe your eyes
Please don't loose your faith
Don't worry cause I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face that I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I’m here to wipe your eyes
Tonight before you fall asleep
I’ll run my thumb across your cheek
Cry, ’cause I’m here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You got to breathe we’ll be okay
Cry, ’cause I’m here to wipe your eyes
