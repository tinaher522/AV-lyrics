How you feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And no
I've gone out of my way, but I'm not free
From this pain, I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think someday you would come around
But no no no
I'm not thinkin' that way
'Cause now I see
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream
I think you should just go away, 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it, baby, you're not comin' in
How's your day been?
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns
But no no no 
I feel better today
'Cause I'm off my knees
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream
I think you should just go away, 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it, baby, you're not comin' in
A heart made for a lot of sorrow
No, you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore, yeah
I think you should just go away, 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it, baby, you're not comin' in
A heart made for a lot of sorrow
No, you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore
Ohh, yeah...
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore
