<song artist="Maroon_5" title="To_Her,_With_Love">
See my dear I'm thinking of you
My how she has grown
her building blocks have all gone home
And being there is always where
I'll be
You'll see
Take your doll
House dreams and make them real
I've seen the sun
I'll guide your
inspirations along
And don't let them stop you from being someone's friend
Don't bend
I hope you
always keep your hand this close to mine
And I hope you
never hesitate to wonder why
Wonder why
Wonder why
If you need a shoulder mine is here
And I love you
And no one can tell you what to do
And roses and diamonds could never take
the place
of your face
I hope you
never hesitate to wonder why
wonder why
wonder why
