<song artist="Maroon_5" title="No_Curtain_Call">
You say you need someone 
But everybody does 
I'm no different than you 
I just believe what I do 
You point your finger at 
Everyone but yourself 
And blame the ones that you love 
Who're only tryin' to help 
As it's winding down to zero 
I am your unlikely hero 
I'll see this through 
There's so much me in you 
Take this enemy together 
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call
I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for 
No curtain call
Just take it all 
I have no time for fear 
Or people in my ear 
Head down and running so fast 
Try not to dwell on the past 
I'm fighting through this pain 
And things I cannot change 
Running right into the flame 
Rather than running away 
As it's winding down to zero 
I am your unlikely hero 
I'll see this through 
There's so much me in you 
Take this enemy together 
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call
I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for 
No curtain call
Just take it all 
Sweat drips down from every angle 
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet 
You turn up the heat 
Tossin' and turnin'
You cannot sleep 
Quietly weep
You're in too deep 
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call
I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for 
No curtain call
Just take it all 
(repeat)
