<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Doin'_Dirt">
Oh yeah, ahh yeah
Hey you
Don't want to love you on the telephone
You hang it up and I am all alone
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
And now
I wanna find you but you're on the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts
Hold me
We're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby, make it loud
Hey you say that you're only having fun
And then you call me up at 3am again
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
And now all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts
Oh, hold me
We're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby make it loud
Yeah, come on
So right now
I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night
Get in the car and let's go
Yeah let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home
So right now
I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night
Get in the car and let's go
Yeah let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home
Oh, hold me
We're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby make it loud
