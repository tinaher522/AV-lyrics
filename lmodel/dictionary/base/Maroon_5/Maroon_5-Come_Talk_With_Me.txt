<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Come_Talk_With_Me">
Come talk with me 
take off your coat 
sit down for awhile 
stick around for awhile 
it's been a long year 
my luck is down think 
I'll skip town for awhile 
to search for my smile 
You look so nice 
you shine just like an angel 
but I'm sure that you must get that all the time 
Have you heard that new song on the radio 
it reminds me of us 
but I forget how it goes 
its been a long week 
and my mind is tired 
I think I'll sit down for a while 
settle down for a while 
you look so nice 
you shine just like the morning 
and at 9PM you glow just like the night 
as all these weeks roll by I wonder why 
you won't talk with me why 
why does it make me crazy when I know 
you're coming down down down 
you're coming down down down down down 
you won't see me 
you won't leave me 
leave me where I am I am 
you won't see me 
you won't leave me 
leave me where I am 
as all these weeks roll by I wonder why 
you won't talk with me why 
why does it make me crazy when I know 
you're coming down down down 
you're coming down down down down down 
as all these weeks roll by I wonder why 
you won't talk with me why 
why does it make me crazy when I know 
you're coming down down down 
you're coming down down down down down 
come talk with me 
take off your coat 
sit down for a while 
stick around for a while
