<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Spoke_With_Kate_(And_She_Said)">
Spoke with Kate late last night
With hopes to get my fix of her advice
Inquired about a mutual friend
And the meaning that I held in her life
And she said "when ya gonna learn,
She must create her own reality to survive
And she said "when ya gonna learn
That those geminis will get you every time
As the conversation moved along I was mystified by the eloquence of her words
Which made everything I said look so confusing and entirely absurd
And she said "when ya gonna learn,
She must create her own reality to survive
She said "when ya gonna learn
That those geminis will get you every time
Spoke with Kate late last night with
-hopes to answer the phone that was ringing loud
Jesse why don't you go get it
Because we don't want them to not leave a message for us
And I said when ya gonna learn?
Who is it?
I don't know who it is
But whoever it is will gain a new significance in our life because while we
Were demoing this song
They called to say hello
They've just bought themself into this song
They didn't know what they were getting into when they dialed the numbers
Who is it?
Oh my god
She's now in this song
Forever
