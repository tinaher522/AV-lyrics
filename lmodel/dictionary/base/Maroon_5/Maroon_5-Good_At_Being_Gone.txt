<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Good_At_Being_Gone">
I've taken time
to think about the words I've said and what they mean
and I've realized that having you is just like having everything
But when I see you dancing there
I get up and throw my hands in the air
when I've nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
It's been so long
it seems the only things I know are far from home
where did I go
it seems sometimes I'm only good at being gone
But when I see you dancing there
I get up and throw my hands in the air
when I've nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
But when I see you standing there
I get up and throw my hands in the air
when I've nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
When I've nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
home, home
When I've nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
