<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Secret">
Watch the sunrise 
Say your goodbyes 
Off we go 
Some conversation 
No contemplation 
Hit the road 
Car overheats 
Jump out of my seat 
On the side of the highway, baby 
Our road is long 
Your hold is strong 
Please don't ever let go, oh no 
I know I don't know you 
But I want you so bad 
Everyone has a secret 
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't 
I'm driving fast now 
Don't think I know how 
To go slow 
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around 
There you are 
Cool these engines, calm these jets 
I ask you, how hot can it get?
And as you wipe off beads of sweat 
Slowly you say, I'm not there yet
I know I don't know you 
But I want you so bad 
Everyone has a secret 
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't 
I know I don't know you 
But I want you so bad 
Everyone has a secret 
Oh, but can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't
