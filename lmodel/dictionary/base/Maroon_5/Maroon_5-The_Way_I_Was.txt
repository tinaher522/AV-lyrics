<song artist="Maroon_5" title="The_Way_I_Was">
Making love to a picture frame one more time, tonight
You can tell by the lines in your smile something is not right
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside, crying
Just another crazy boy, hungry for you'reÂ…
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a, warm glove
Your emptiness needs me and I'm filled up
Never need to go to back to the way I was
The way I was
I've tried and tried and tried and tried
But I know no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She treats me like no other
So old
Dripping from head to toe
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a, warm glove
Your emptiness meets me and I'm filled up
Never need to go to back to the way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
Your emptiness needs me and I'm filled up
Never need to go to back to the way I was
The way I was
Now I can't make the same mistake
If ya lose my love it was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more with
I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving
It's a, new love
Try and pick me up again but
Let go
See how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a, warm glove
Your emptiness needs me and I'm filled up
Never need to go to back to the way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a, warm glove
Your emptiness needs me and I'm filled up
Never need to go to back to the way I was
The way I was
