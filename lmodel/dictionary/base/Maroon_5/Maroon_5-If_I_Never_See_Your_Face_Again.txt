<song artist="Maroon_5" title="If_I_Never_See_Your_Face_Again">
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Sometimes you move so well it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another manÂ¹
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind (Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time (Torture me, torture me)
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight (Torture me, torture me)
You keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
