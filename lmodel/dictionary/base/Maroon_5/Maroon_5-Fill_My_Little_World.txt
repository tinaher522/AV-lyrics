<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Fill_My_Little_World">
I had a dream we went away
Left this city for a day
You took me southwards on a plane
And showed me Spain or somewhere
But in reality you're not so keen to show me anything
And I thought you liked me
Hey, show some love, you ain't so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realize
(I want you)
To fill my little world right up, right up, right up
Yeah, so what you gonna do
With all this stuff piling up, filling up and taking up
You misunderstand me
All I wanted was some evidence
That you really like me
(You really like me)
Hey, show some love, you ain't so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realize
(I want you)
To fill my little world right up, right up, right up
Maybe it's all too much
How come we're so messed up
Maybe I'm not in love
Maybe you're just too much
Hey, show some love, you ain't so tough
Come fill my little world right up
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Hey, show some love, you ain't so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realize
(I want you)
To fill my little world right up, right up
Hey, show some love, you ain't so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realize
That I'm passing you by
So fill your little world right up, right up, right up
Oh
Come on and show me you ain't so tough
