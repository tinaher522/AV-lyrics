[Verse 1]
This relationship is
though my stomach still hurts.
Why is the pain much worse?
You're so much better with makeup,
Why would you hide your face?
Want to spend the night and wake up,
Realize I've made a big mistake.
[Chorus]
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there.
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
[Verse 2]
I never meant to keep you waiting,
and now your food is getting cold,
I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old.
And now you stand in front of the table,
And say you never look back.
You only wake up sad.
[Chorus]
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there.
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
More kisses on your lips, tender touch or...
I'd rather try on my two feet than live down on my knees.
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be
And I just can't get over you, and until you're over me.
[Chorus]
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there.
I can not refuse your eyes,
Please look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.
