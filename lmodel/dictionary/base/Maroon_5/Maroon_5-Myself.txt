<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Myself">
I have told 
All of my enemies 
Very politely 
To go home. 
I have seen 
All of your remedies 
Now won't you let me please go home. 
I can't find anything to be sad about. 
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine. 
I have tried 
So very hard as hell 
To stay away from hell
And live upstairs. 
When I see 
All of your remedies 
I try quite desperately to go home. 
I can't find anything to be sad about. 
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine. 
But if I'm sitting here lonely, 
With no one to hold me, 
At least I'll have my health. 
I'm tryin to control myself. 
I have told 
All of my enemies 
Very politely 
To go home. 
I have seen 
All of your remedies 
now won't you let me please go home. 
I've been acting irresponsibly 
Oh what could possibly go wrong. 
I have choked on all your remedies 
Now won't you let me please go home. 
But if I'm sitting here lonely, 
With no one to hold me, 
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself. 
I'm trying to control myself.
