<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Give_A_Little_More_Remix">
Can we start from getting uh
Give me life, give me love
Waiting for the day shes uh
Flowers grow from the mud
Time is precious, mine is gorgeous
Patience, ugly, almost over
Love is war, falling soldier
Pay attention, can't afford it
Told her things I never said
Things I've never done before
Give my all, expecting more
Tried of this, rest assure
We playing games, whats the score?
This feels like revolving doors
I'm just trying to get up on her train of thought
All aboard
I'm Weezy, don't tease me
Just guide me, don't leave me
Come see me, you need me
Believe me baby
I am Weezy, don't tease me
Just guide me, don't leave me
You need me
But I'm not falling in love that easy baby
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
You were wrong for turning me on
And on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
Then I give a little more, ooh, babe
Give a little more, ooh, babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end
And I cannot pretend
I never wanna feel this way again
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
