<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Is_Anybody_Out_There">
I won't let anybody hurt you
And I'll stop them if they try to
Nobody knows you like I do baby
And I don't care where you run to
'Cause I am gonna find you
When the stars all align
We can try again again
(Chorus)
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby
So where did all your love go?
You played me like a solo
Then you threw my broken heart away
And I know that we can make it
And the closer I can feel it 
So stop fooling around and just stay
(Chorus)
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby
(PJ Morton)
It's taken such a long time
To find what I've been looking for 
And now that you are all mine 
I've never felt quite like this before
Stil want more
Are you really mine?
Because if so than you already know
You're all that I want and you're all that I needed 
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby
