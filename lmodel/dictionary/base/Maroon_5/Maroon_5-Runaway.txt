<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Runaway">
What am I supposed to do with this time
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I
Feel out of control, so petrified
I'm petrified
What am I supposed to do to get by
Did I loose everything I need to survive?
Coz at 4 AM when the sweats sets in
Did you get my message, did it send
Or did you just get on with your life?
I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away, run away
What am I supposed to do with these clothes
It's my twisted way of keep you close
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message, did it send
Or do you get along on your own?
I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away, run away
And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand, I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends, why did it have to end?
I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away, run away
I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away, run away
Run away, run away
Turn around and run away, run away
Run away, run away
But I can't tell you if you run away, run away
Run away, run away
Turn around and run away
