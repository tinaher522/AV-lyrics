<song artist="Maroon_5" title="The_Powers_That_Be">
The day is done
And everyone
Has spent this summer day out in the rain
Has wandered into someone else's lane
You know exactly what I mean
Ah, but everyone
Has felt the sun
We all have fallen victim to the day
You know we've all been several minutes late
You know exactly what I mean
Chorus:
If you believe
In everything you see
And everything you read
That's not me
And I have this feeling no one knows me
Today was fun
For everyone
We all have had our problems of our own
We've all been sitting waiting by the phone
You know exactly what I mean
[Repeat chorus]
And if today
Were any other day
I promise that I
Would wrestle the powers that be
But I have this feeling no one knows me
[Bridge]
(Ahhh, Ahhhh)
If you believe
In everything you see
And everything you read
That's not me
And I have this feeling no one -
And if today
Were any other day
I promise that I
Would wrestle the powers that be (the powers that be)
And I have this feeling no one knows me
