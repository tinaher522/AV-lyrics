<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Woman">
If I'd be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right? 
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?
Leavin' her smell on my coat
Leavin' her taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand 
What it is about this woman
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And if I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen
Leavin' her clothes on my floor
Makin' me walk out the door
And I just fail to understand 
What it is about this woman
Fail to understand 
What it is about this woman, yeah
Ooh...
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
And as she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spoon me out on to the floor
Leavin' her smell on my coat
Leavin' her taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand
Fail to understand
Leavin' her smell on my coat
Leavin' her taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand
What it is about this woman, yeah
Ooh...
Yeah...
