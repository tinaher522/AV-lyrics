<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Take_What_You_Want">
I woke up this morning 
with the buring of love hanging over my head
as i, walked into the living room
sit with you
discuss whats going on
is it me?
is it you?
is it something i forgot to do?
oh, tell me so that i understand
i just need some time
gather all my thoughts
to make up for the love i just lost
you've, been so good to me
given me everything,
take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me
i woke up this morning with a hurting
that i would never ever wish upon
even my worst enemy
who is she?
what the hell do you people want
is it me?
is it you?
is it something i forgot to do?
oh, tell me so that i understand
oh, i just need some time
gather all my thoughts
to make up for the love i just lost
you've, been so good to me
given me everything,
take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway
