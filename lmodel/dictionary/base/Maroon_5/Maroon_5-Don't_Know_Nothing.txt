<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Don't_Know_Nothing">
Living inside my head pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control
Giving you all of my heart was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all yeah
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)
So tell me what you really want (really want)
Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be alone
Oooooooh Oooooooh
(uh) Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone
Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over oh no
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)
Gotta tell me what you really want (you want)
Cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be alone
(ooooooh oooooooh)
(I don't wanna be)
I'm putting myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why
She will not talk to me
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)
Tell me what you really want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone
Oooooooh Oooooooh
