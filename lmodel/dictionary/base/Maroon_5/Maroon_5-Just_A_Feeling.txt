<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Just_A_Feeling">
I watched you cry, bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door 
You said you wished you did not love me anymore 
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car 
The things we said and did have left permanent scars
Obsessed, depressed at the same time 
I can't even walk in a straight line 
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine 
No sunshine 
No sunshine 
She cries
This is more than goodbye 
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there
It's just a feeling 
Just a feeling 
Just a feeling that I have 
Just a feeling 
Just a feeling that I have 
Cuz' I can't believe that it's over
You've hit your low, you've lost control and you want me back 
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have 
Oh just confess that you're still mine 
I roll around in a bed full of tears, and 
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine 
No sunshine 
No sunshine 
She cries
This is more than goodbye 
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there 
It's just a feeling 
Just a feeling 
Just a feeling that I have 
Just a feeling 
Just a feeling that I have 
No I can't believe that it's over now, baby
So much to say, it's not the way she does her hair 
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes 
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away 
From love she tried so hard to save...
It's just a feeling 
Just a feeling 
Just a feeling that I have 
Just a feeling 
Just a feeling that I have
(It's just a feeling)
It's just a feeling 
Just a feeling 
Just a feeling that I have 
Just a feeling (Ohh, ohh)
Just a feeling that I have 
And I can't believe that it's over now
I can't believe that it's over
And I can't believe that it's over
