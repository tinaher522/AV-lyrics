<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Vanessa">
Oh Vanessa holding up time with her beautiful [ ] eyes
She danced in the rain
Got lost in our games
Turned our back to the world that night
Fell asleep in the grass
Watch out for the passing of seasons
As days take our innocence
We could've been safe
But we came of age
A summer too soon for Vanessa
Ooooh
Ooooh
She's beautiful
Before she starts to cry
How many stars reflected in her eyes?
Vanessa
Ooooh
Ooooh
She's beautiful
Before she starts to cry
How many stars reflected in her eyes?
Vanessa
Ooooh
Ooooh
