<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Someone_More_Comfortable">
Wouldn't it be nice to slip into tomorrow
Wouldn't it feel nice to bathe in yesterday
Wouldn't it be nice to take ta hunting rifle
Empty out the chamber
Fill it with roses and say
"So you want to be a superman
Just can't escape from your own skin
Running down the street saying I'm no criminal
Let me slip into someone more comfortable"
Wouldn't it be nice to slip into tomorrow
Wouldn't it be feel to bathe in yesterday
Wouldn't it be nice to take the hunting rifle
Empty out the chamber
Fill it with roses and say
"So you want to be a superman
Just can't escape from your own skin
Running down the street yelling I'm no criminal
Let me slip into someone more comfortable"
