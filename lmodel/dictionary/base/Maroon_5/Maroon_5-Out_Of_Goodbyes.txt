<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Out_Of_Goodbyes">
Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words
That hurts
Closing up, it's so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya
To lock the door
And on our way home I realize
There's some kinda storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise
And now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes
Out of goodbyes
Never ask you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same
About me
I wonder, does your man
Still shudder when you touch his hand
Like this man?
And on our way home I realize
There's some kinda storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise
And now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
Cause we're out of goodbyes (out of goodbyes)
We're out of goodbyes (out of goodbyes)
We're out of goodbyes (out of goodbyes)
