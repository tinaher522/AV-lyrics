<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Shayanni's_Surprise">
Like a sunrise happening at three am
On a walk in the middle of the night
You may not have a clue
It's something you just knew
And something you were always dreaming of
But tip your hat towards the sky
And stand back while your tears get dry
Happiness is always on the move
You can wonder if it's warm inside
Stay out till your feet get tired
Watch out for that  shayanni surprise
Just because we're waiting for the lottery
Doesn't mean that we can live our lives for free
And I've seen illusions
But shayanni's surprise
Got me right behind the eyes
Even in the midst of all of life's unpleasant gifts
Someone out there's got it twice as bad
So thank your lucky stars
And take a look at who you are
And never waste another day again
Pin a note upon your sleeve and read it out before you leave
'cause everybody loves a valentine
But you know just as well as I
That we are all in pantomime
Waiting for our shayanni surprise
Just because we're waiting for the lottery
Doesn't mean that we can live our lives for free
I've seen illusions
But shayanni's surprise
Got me right behind the eyes
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Just because we're waiting for the lottery
Doesn't mean that we can live our lives for free
I've seen illusions
But shayanni's surprise
Got me right behind the eyes
