<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Shoot_Love">
Yeah, you got to let it go
Cause we're losing grip now
It's about to go down
Would you let me talk to you?
You got to let me know
Cause I'm on the edge now
Of a nervous breakdown
Cause I can't get through to you
I got my hands up, speak me
Got my hands up, speeding love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot
Yeah, you never let me go
Got me chained to your touch
Like a slave for your love
I'm ashamed to say it's true
Afraid to let you go
Cause without you I'm lost
And no matter the cost
I'll be standing next to you
I got my hands up, speak me
Got my hands up, speeding love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot
My back's against the wall tonight
So go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot the lights out
Go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot the lights out
I see the fear within your eyes
So go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot the lights out
Go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot
I got my hands up, speak me
Got my hands up, speeding love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby don't shoot
