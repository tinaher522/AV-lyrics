<song artist="Maroon_5" title="Grave_Condition">
It's time
To find out what is the deal
To try and find some way to feel
Because it can't be this lonely
Can't be this lonely in here
Slowly we all disappear
There must be time
To define this grave condition
It won't be long
It won't be long
It won't be long
It won't be long
It's time
To find out who it is that I am
To scrape away the garbage I can
Because it can't be this lonely
Can't be this lonely in here
Slowly we all disappear
It won't be long
It won't be long
It won't be long
It won't be long
When I'm lonely
And I'm strung out
Let me be 'cause I'm not right
This is only
My condition
And I may be another night
[Repeat x 2]
