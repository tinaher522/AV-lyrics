Help
Where do you wanna go?
Down to Mexico
For awhile
I'm fine here in the sunshine
Everything's so devine
Talk down hi fi lo
Someone told me long ago
It feels the best when you take it slow
'cause when it's ninety degrees
And you're feeling alone
It's like a cold drink for your mind
Don't stop
Fighting off rain drops
Taking a non-stop
To the sun
I'm fine here in the sunshine
And you look so fine
When you take it slow
Someone told me long ago
It feels the best when you take it slow
'cause when it's ninety degrees
And you're feeling alone
It's like a cold drink for your mind
Someone told me long ago
It feels the best when you take it slow
'cause when it's ninety degrees
And you're feeling alone
It's like a cold drink for your mind
It's like a cold drink for your mind
It's like a cold drink for your mind
It's like a cold drink for your mind....
