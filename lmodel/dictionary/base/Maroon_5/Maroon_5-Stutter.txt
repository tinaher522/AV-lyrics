I really
I really
(Whoooooaaaaaa)
I really need to knooooowwww
I really
I really
(Whoooooaaaaaa)
or else ya gotta let me goooooo 
I really
I really
This time I really need to do things right 
The Shivers that ya give me keep me freezing all night 
You make me shudder, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinkin' about no one else 
You make me shudde
I really, I really need to knooooowwww
Or else ya gotta let me goooooo 
Oh
You're just a fantasy girl, 
It's an impossible world 
All I want is to be with you always 
I give you everything 
Pay some attention to me 
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection 
I need your perfection 
'Cause you feel so good 
You make me s-s-stutter, stutter
(ooh)
If I could touch you, I'd never let go 
Now you got me screaming and I cannot
Shut up, oh shut up
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I can not
Get up
And I really, I really need to knooooowwww
Or else ya gotta let me goooooo 
You're just a fantasy girl, 
It's an impossible world  
All I want is to be with you always 
I give you everything 
Pay some attention to me 
All I want is just you and me always 
Give me affection 
I need your perfection 
'Cause you feel so good 
You make me s-s-stutter,(I really) stutter
(I really)
Stutter
You knock me down, I can't get up
I'm stuck here, gotta stop shaking me up 
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think
Sinking under, I'm sinkin' under
You're just a fantasy girl 
It's an impossible world 
All I want is to be with you always 
I give you everything 
Pay some attention to me 
All I want is you and me always 
You're just a fantasy girl,
It's an impossible world  
All I want is to be with you always 
Give me affection 
I need your perfection 
'Cause you feel so good 
You make me s-s-stutter 
(I really,I really)
You make me s-s-stutter 
(I really,I really)
You make me s-s-stutter
