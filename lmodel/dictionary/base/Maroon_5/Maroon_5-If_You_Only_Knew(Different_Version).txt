<song artist="Maroon_5" title="If_You_Only_Knew(Different_Version)">
There's this beat in my heart
And I don't know what to do with it
And you show me the sign like a difficult scene in a movie
You have me call my way to tease the [?]
If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
If you only knew
What I went through now the day is through
With all this haste in my life
I don't know what I want to do
All my baby's [?]
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my time
[?]
Oh no
If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
If you only knew
What I went through now my day is through
If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
If you only knew
What I went through now my day is through
[spoken]
If you only knew
What it feels like
California living in June
If you only knew
All of the powerful things I'd like to do to you
