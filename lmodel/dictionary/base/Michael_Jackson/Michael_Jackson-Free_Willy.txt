<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Free_Willy">
Hold me like the river Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You're my friend
Carry me, like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be thee
Weary, tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human
Everyone taking control of me
Seems that the world's
Got a role for me I'm so confused
Will you should to me you'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me
Hold me, lay your head lowly
Softly then boldly carry me there
Hold me, love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me, I will feel blessed
Carry, carry me boldly, lift me up slowly
Carry me there, save me, heal me and bathe me
Softly you say to me, I will be there
Lift me, lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly, show me you care
Hold me, lay your head lowly
Softly then boldly, carry me there
Need me, love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me, I will feel blessed
In our darkest hour in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart
