<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Sunset_Driver">
All alone 
She's in the ego zone 
The word is out that you're doin' wrong 
On the move 
Got fire in your shoes 
By word of mouth you are on the news 
You're livin' in sunset times (Livin' in sunset times) 
Feelin' bad
You're livin' much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw 
They don't know what you saw 
By word of mouth you're breakin' every law 
Sunset driver 
Midnight rider 
Friday's brighter 
Morning rider 
You're a Saturday-nighter, aow! 
On the go 
Got fever in your soul 
You better not shout where you gonna go 
Livin' hot 
Doin' what you should not 
The break's on me, then what do you got 
You're livin' on sunset times (Livin' on sunset times) 
Want that dime 
Shoot the breeze 
You feel that she's a tease 
Your night is free, what you wanna be 
Who's to trust 
When livin' dangerous 
Tonight's your night, but this is what you loose 
Sunset driver 
Midnight rider 
Friday's brighter 
Gettin' higher 
You're a Saturday-nighter, aow! 
You are there when the night's in town 
Standin' there with the top of the round 
They don't care about the things you wished you saw 
You're like the cinema 
You think that nothin's wrong 
Doin' town 
You do it every time 
The word's got out that you're on the line 
On the move 
Got fever in your shoes 
The night's on you, what are you gonna do? 
Sunset driver 
Midnight rider 
Friday's brighter 
Just to reach that driver 
The Saturday-nighter, aow!
