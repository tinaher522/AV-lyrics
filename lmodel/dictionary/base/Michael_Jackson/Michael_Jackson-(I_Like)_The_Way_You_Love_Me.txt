<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="(I_Like)_The_Way_You_Love_Me">
Ok..this is the tempo and the melody..
"I was alone dark when I met ya"
drums
I was alone in the dark when I met ya
 Oooooooooh ooooooh
 You took my hand and you told me you loved me
 Oooooooooooh ooooooh
 I was alone, there was no love in my life
 (I was alone, there was no love in my life)
 I was afraid of life and you came in time
 (I was afraid of life and you came in time)
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
 (You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
 Ooooooooooh ooooooh

 I like the way how you're holdin' me
 It doesn't matter how you're holdin' me
 I like the way you're lovin me'
 It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me
 I like the way how you're touchin' me
 It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
 I like the way how you're kissin' me
 It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
 You'll seeeee...

 ...it won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
 Oooooooh ooooooh
 I thank the Heavens above that I met ya
 Ooooooooh ooooooh
 I was alone, there was no love in my life
 (I was alone, there was no love in my life)
 I was afraid of life and you came in time
 (I was afraid of life and you came in time)
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
 (You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
 Ooooooooh

 I like the way how you're lovin' me
 It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
 I like the way how you're holdin' me
 It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me
 I like the way how you're touchin' me
 It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
 I like the way how you're kissin' me
 It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me

 The world's a better place
 'cause you came in time,
 You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
 I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
 Ooooooooooh Ahhhhhhhh.

 I like the way how you're holdin' me,
 It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,
 I like the way how you're lovin' me,
 It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,
 I like the way how you're touchin' me,
 It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,
 I like the way how you're kissin' me,
 It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,
 You'll seeeee.
