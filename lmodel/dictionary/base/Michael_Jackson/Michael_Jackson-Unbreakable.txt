<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Unbreakable">
Yeah, Yeah...
Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through I'm still around
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
(Come on) Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby (See I'm) (Ha!)
You can't believe it you can't concieve it
And you can't touch me 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it and you can't take it
You'll never break me 'cause I'm unbreakable
You know that, I'm, ah, well
Now you can't stop me even though you think
That if you block me you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin' while surfacing
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes (Can't)
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
(Come on) 'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby (I'm too much for you baby)
You can't believe it, you can't concieve it
And you can't touch me 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (You can't break me)
You can't believe it, you can't concieve it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (You can't touch me)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Come on now) (Yeah-eah-eah)
You'll never break me,
You can't stand with me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same,
I'm unbreakable (Uh, uh, what, uh)
Lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringin in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly nines and macs
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them
HELLO?!
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in
Crack braggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin
Desert ease street sweeper inside the beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin with the devil
WHAT!!
You can't believe it, you can't concieve it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (I'm untouchable) ('Cause I'm Untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (Ah-ah-ah-ah) (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it you can't concieve it (You-you-you-you-you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (Yeah, yeah)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (You hate it) (Ooooh)
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable ('Cause I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, you can't concieve it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Hoo, hoo!)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (Yeah) (Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Why you do it) (Just why you do it)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo) You'll never break me,
You can't touch me
You can't break me
You can't stand with me
'Cause I'm unbreakable
OWW!
GO ON!
