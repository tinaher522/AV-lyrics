VERSE ONE
You know I work to hard for this kinda play, (ho!)
I wrote a letter, for the getto of the CIA, (ho!)
I don't care a jack, or about what cha' do, (ho!)
Just put ya dime on the line baby, cos i own you, (ho!)
CHORUS
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, (ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need 
(I aint takin it..ya,)
Cheater (oooooh!, Do it!, What!, (Ya Got) Do it!, What! (Get back on me...))
VERSE TWO

Ya smilin at me while, ya stealin right before my eyes (Daggone it (ho!))

Cheater (ooooooooooh! Do it!, What, Do it!, What!, Get back on me...)
BRIDGE
I hurt my backbone baby,
I start to give it up,
Life is an aggrovator,
Sumtimes I part it up,
I broke my radiator, 
I live to starve the bone,
I pray to leave my body,
Don't you ever call!
VERSE THREE
I dont care a jack, or about what you do (ho!)
Just sign your name on the line baby, I own you (Daggone it)
(You are a...) 
Cheater (oooo0000ooh!, Give it to me, What!, What!, get jack on me...)
CHORUS
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, (aah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need,
(I aint takin' it..!)
Cheater... (ooohh) Daggone it, Got-Give Give it to me, (cheatin baby)
(You are a..) Cheater...
