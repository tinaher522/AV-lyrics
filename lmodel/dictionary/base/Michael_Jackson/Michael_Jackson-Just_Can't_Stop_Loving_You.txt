<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Just_Can't_Stop_Loving_You">
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so, I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart at your call
I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on and I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel, I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying 'I do'
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you
(No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you
(If I can't stop)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you
(Know I do girl)
I just can't stop loving you
(You know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
