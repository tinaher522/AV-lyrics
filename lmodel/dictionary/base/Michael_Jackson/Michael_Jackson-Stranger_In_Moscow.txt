<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Stranger_In_Moscow">
I was wandering in the rain
(Mask of life, feeling insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace
(Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
(Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on it came
(Wish the rain would just let me)
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Here abandoned in my fame
(Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was stalking me
(Take my name and just let me be)
Then a beggar boy called my name (Hee!)
(Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
(Take my name and just let me be)
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
ChildÂ :
Hey, Michael!
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Like stranger in Moscow
Lord Have Mercy
Like stranger in Moscow (Hee!)
Lord Have Mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow
(KGB interrogator - Russian to English Translation)
"Why have you come from the West?
Confess! To steal the great achievements of
the people, the accomplishments of the workers?
Confess! To bribe people the wealth of the West remained?
Confess!"
