What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores
Aah ah aaaaah aah aah aah aaaaah aaah aaaaaaaaaaaah
Uuh uuh uuuuuuh uuuh uuuuh uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
Aah ah aaaaah aah aah aah aaaaah aaah aaaaaaaaaaaah
Uuh uuh uuuuuuh uuuh uuuuh uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
What have we've done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son
What about flowering fields
Is there a time

What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, theses weeping shores
Aah ah aaaaah aah aah aah aaaaah aaah aaaaaaaaaaaah
Uuh uuh uuuuuuh uuuh uuuuh uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
Aah ah aaaaah aah aah aah aaaaah aaah aaaaaaaaaaaah
Uuh uuh uuuuuuh uuuh uuuuh uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores
Aah ah aaaaah aah aah aah aaaaah aaah aaaaaaaaaaaah
Uuh uuh uuuuuuh uuuh uuuuh uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
Aah ah aaaaah aah aah aah aaaaah aaah aaaaaaaaaaaah
Uuh uuh uuuuuuh uuuh uuuuh uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
