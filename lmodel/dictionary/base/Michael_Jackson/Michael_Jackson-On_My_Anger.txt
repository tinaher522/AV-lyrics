<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="On_My_Anger">
Baby
Now I'm Mad
The World Treats Me Like An Everyday Dump
They Call Me Names, Threaten My Family
And I Always Say
On My Anger
On My Anger
Tonight
On My Anger
On My Anger
It's Gonna Be A Bite
Honey
What You Do To Me
You Strike Me Like A Lightning Bolt
And
Baby
Won't You Stay For Awhile
Cause Fame Is Treating Me Insane
On My Anger
On My Anger
Tonight
On My Anger
On My Anger
It's Gonna Be A Bite
On My Anger
On My Anger
Tonight
On My Anger
On My Anger
It's Gonna Be A Bite
And Now I'm Trying To Move On
Though It Feels Like Nobody Loves Me
And Now I'm All Beat Up
By The Gangster Down The Street!
On My Anger
On My Anger
Tonight
On My Anger
On My Anger
It's Gonna Be A Bite
On My Anger
On My Anger
Tonight
On My Anger
On My Anger
It's Gonna Be A Bite
