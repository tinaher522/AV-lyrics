Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
when glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
Oh baby give me one more chance
(show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(back to your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
Yes I do now
(I want you back)
Ooh ooh baby
(I want you back)
Ya ya ya ya
(I want you back)
Na na na na
(I want you back)
Back...

That's how easy love can be
Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it! 
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!
Stop! The love you save may be your own! 
Darling, take it slow 
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop
The love you save may be your own! 
Darling, look both ways before you cross me 
You're headed for the danger zone
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
S is for "Save it" 
T is for "Take it slow" 
O is for "Oh, no!" 
P is for "Please, please, don't go!"
