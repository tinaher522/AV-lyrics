<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Ghosts">
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's bless the tune
Because now it's haunting me
Don't understand it
Don't understand it
Ow!
There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one seem there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is pokin'
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it
Want to)
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it
Want to)
(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it
Want to)
(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it)
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby? She needs me!
And who gave you the right to shake my fablic tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's seem there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it

(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it
Want to)
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it
Want to)
(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it
Want to)
(Got a ghost
Got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul
Got a break in the halls
Got to see it)
And who gave you the right to scheme my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby? She needs me!
And who gave you the right to shake my fablic tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion?
To see me!
And who gave you the right to shame my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby?
She needs me!
And who gave you the right to shake my fablic trees?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
And who gave you the right to shame my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby? She needs me!
And who gave you the right to shake my fablic tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion?
To see me!
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby?
She needs me!
And who gave you the right to shake my fablic tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
Come on!
But it's dynamite
A peace of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
