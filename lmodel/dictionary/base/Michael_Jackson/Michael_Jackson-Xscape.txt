Xscape (Ow)
Xscape (Ow)
Xscape
Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look, 
The systems in control, it's all ran by the book,
I've got to get away so I can clear my mind,
Xscape is what I need, away from electric eyes
No matter where I am, I seen my face around,
They pin lies on my name, and push them from town to town,
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide,
I've got to, find a place,
So I won't hide away
Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships that go away
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
Sometimes I feel like
I've gotta get away
I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, its time to make a change
Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (oh)
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you (you)
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me (try it)
You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to
Xscape, (hoo-hoo) (oh, no)
got to get away from a system loose in the world today
(I've got to get away)
Xscape,
the pressure that I face from relationships that go away
(don't you know I need it?)
Xscape,
the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
(I've got to get away)
Xscape,
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
(get away)
Xscape,
(don't you try it)
got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape,
the pressure that I face from relationships that go away 
(pressure that I'm facing every day)
Xscape,
(hoo-hoo)
the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
(come on, now)
Xscape,
(come on, now) 
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
(hoo-hoo)
When I go, (oh, go) this problem world won't bother me no more
(This problem world won't bother me no more)
(problem world, bother me, yeah, oh, yeah, hoo)
Xscape
Xscape
Xscape
Xscape
Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
(I've got to find a way)
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships that go away
(pressure that I'm facing)
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
(why I wanna fly)
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
(I do what I wanna, hoo-hoo)
Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships that go away
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me (hoo-hoo)
Xscape, got to get away
(I've got find a way)
Xscape, the pressure that I face
(can't take it no more)
Xscape, the man with the pen
(I can't take this no more)
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
Xscape (ow!)
(You ain't my mother)
Xscape
Got to get away
Xscape
The pressure that I face
Xscape
The man with the pen (get away)
Xscape
I do what I wanna
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me (hee-hee-hee)
(Hoo)
Xscape
(what for? I can't take this kind of shit no more!)
Xscape till fade
You want me? Come and get me.
