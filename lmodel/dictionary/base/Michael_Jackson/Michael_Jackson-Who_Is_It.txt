<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Who_Is_It">
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold
And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one
We made a vow we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me, what will I do?
And it doesn't seem to matter, and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?) It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?) Is it my brother?
(Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?) I can't take this stuff no more
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me
And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one
We made our vow to live love so true
It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But, see, what will I do?
And it doesn't seem to matter, and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(Who is it?) It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?) Is it my brother?
(Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?) I can't take it cause I'm lonely
Hee, Hee
Hee, Hee
(Spoken:)
Don't try to make me,
Don't try to make me crazy
I never wanted this
It just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
(Who is it?) It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?) To me, I'm bothered
(Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?) (Oww!) I can't take it cause I'm lonely
And it doesn't seem to matter, (Hee, Hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
And it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (Da, Da, Da-rat)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-rat, Da-rat)
Still I cry alone at night (Me? Never, never, never)
Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (You can really see I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter,
And it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Da, Da, Da, Da)
Don't you judge of my composure, (Don't be)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Don't be, don't be judgin')
And the reason why she left me (Don't you, don't you)
Did she find in someone else? (Keep begging 'cause I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-rat, Da-rat)
Still I cry alone at night (Me? Never, never, never)
Don't you judge of my composure, (Don't be judgin')
'Cause I'm bothered everyday (Don't be)
(Don't be) And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter, (Hee, Hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee, Hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure, (She don't, she don't phone me)
'Cause I'm bothered everyday (She gone and did it)
And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't matter)
She just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)
And it doesn't seem to matter, (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (You just did it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da-da)
Still I cry alone at night (Da-da, Da-da, Da)
Don't you judge of my composure, (Hee)
(Hee) 'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
