Who's? (Looking For A Lover?)
Who's? (Looking For A Lover?)
Early this morning while I was yawning
I got a warning thought
Somebody near me who doesn't fear me
Knows things I ain't been taught
Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder
Wants to get hold to me, yeah
(Wants to get hold to me)
Somebody smart wants my young heart
I will a start, I will a start
Chorus:
Who's Looking For A Lover?
Who'll pick me out from all the crowd?
What thrills will I discover?
Why love is scared or do myself proudâ¦?
Who's? (Looking For A Lover?)
Who's? (Looking For A Lover?)
Maybe some honey just wants my money
Hey, that's a funny tought
Someone appealing could set me reeling
And get my feelings caught
Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder (Somebody)
Wants to get hold to me, yeah
(Wants to get hold to me)
Somebody strong help me belong
Answer my song, answer my song
Chorus:
Who's Looking For A Lover?
Who wants to know what I can do?
Who's Looking For A Lover?
I'm looking everywhere for you
Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder (Somebody)
Wants to get hold to me, yeah
(Wants to get hold to me)
Somebody strong help me belong
Answer my song, answer my song
Chorus:
Who's Looking For A Lover?
Who wants to know what I can do?
Who's Looking For A Lover?
I'm looking everywhere for you
Somebody older (Somebody) somebody bolder (Somebody)
Wants to get hold to me, yeah
(Wants to get hold to me)
Somebody strong help me belong
Answer my song, answer my song
