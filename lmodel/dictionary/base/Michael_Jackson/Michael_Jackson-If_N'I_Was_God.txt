If N' I Was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Till everyone was treaded right
By everyone else they see
If N' I Was God
I'd fix it so, without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me
Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh I know, I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except, for thanking me
If N' I Was God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
(Everyone needs everyone)
Everyone needs, everyone
And Godâ¦ that in heaven what I would do
If N' Iâ¦ wereâ¦. youâ¦uh uh â¦
Ah yeah
If N' I Was God
I'd make us wise
Everybody touch
Everybody's hand, ah yeah!
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody, yeah
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to, you got to love everybody wow
You got to love everybody
You got to, you got to everybody
C'mon everybody
C'mon, c'mon everybody, yeah
