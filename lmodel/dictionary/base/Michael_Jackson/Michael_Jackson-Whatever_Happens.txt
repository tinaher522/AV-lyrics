<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Whatever_Happens">
He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares, she can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doin's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tried to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
[Carlos Santana:] Thank you, man!
[Michael Jackson:] Thank you, Carlos!
