<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="I'm_Bad">
Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Come on, come on, lay it on me, alright
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
I'm telling you, just watch your mouth
I know your game, what you're about
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again, who's bad
The word is out you're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lyin' eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
And my friends you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
Just to tell you once again
(Just to tell you once again)
Who's bad
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
Woo, woo, woo
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
(Just to tell you once again)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
Just to tell you
(Just to tell you once again)
You know I'm smooth, I'm bad, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, baby
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know it, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
Woo
(Just to tell you once again)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, you know, hoo
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
Just to tell you once again
(Just to tell you once again)
Who's bad?
