<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Bigger_Man">
See you out on the block 
With your man, 
Got me on the stand
Girl why you hanging around 
When he put u down
So i gotta put you up on me 
Cause it's a shame
That girl you settle for less 
When u know that im blessed
Hook:
You need to open up you're mind(you're mind)
Give me the chance to get inside
(to get inside)
Chorus:
I can i can
Do it better than he can
I will i will
Be a bigger man
I am i am
Everthing you need and more 
Can i can i
Show you im a bigger man
Let me know 
When he can't please you
I'll come right through
He'll give inches or for miles
I can make you smile
Cause i no that you 
Might be afraid to 
Walk away
But i'll protect you 
From him
So let the games began
Hook:
You need to open up your mind
(open up your mind)
Give me the chance to get inside
(to get inside)
Chorus:
I can i can
Do it better than he can
I will i will
Be a bigger man
I am i am
Everything you need and more
Can i can i
Show you im a bigger man
Break down:
I know
(i know)
For sure
That he can never measure up 
Cause i got so much more 
To give you
More
Chorus:
I can i can
Do it better 
I will i will
Be a bigger man
I am i am
Everything you need and more
Can i can i
Show you im a bigger man
I can i can 
Do it better 
I will will
Oh ay oh
I am i am
Yea
Can i can i
Show you im a bigger man
Oh ay oh
