<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Give_Into_Me">
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throws it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say
Love is a feeling give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire, quench my desire
Give it when I want it, talk to me woman
Give into me, give into me
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough
Love is a feeling give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire, quench my desire
Give it when I want it, talk to me woman
Give into me, give into me
You and your friends
Were laughing at me in town
But it's okay and it's okay
You won't be laughing, girl
When I'm not around, I'll be okay
And I, I'm not fine, gotta, the peace of mind no
Don't try to tell me because your words
Just aren't enough
Love is a feeling give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire, quench my desire
Give it when I want it, talk to me woman
Give into me, give into me, give into me
Love is a feeling give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire, quench my desire
Give it when I want it, talk to me woman
Give into me, give into me
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna dream now give it to the fire
Talk to me woman, quench my desire
Not like a lady talk to me, baby
Give into me
Give into the fire, give into me
Give into me, give into me
Love a woman, give into me
Give into me, give into me
Give into me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me woman
Quench my desire
Give into the feeling
