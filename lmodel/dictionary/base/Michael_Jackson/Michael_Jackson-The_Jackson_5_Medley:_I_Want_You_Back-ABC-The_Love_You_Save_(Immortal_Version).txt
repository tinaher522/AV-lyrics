When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
 Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd
 But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance is all it took
 Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
 Oh baby, give me one more chance
 (To show you that I love you)
 Won't you please let me back in your heart
 Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
 (Let you go, baby)
 But now since I've seen you it is on
 (I want you back)
 Oh I do now
 (I want you back)
 Ooh ooh baby
 (I want you back)
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah
 (I want you back)
 Na na na na
 Back
 You went to school to learn girl
 Things you never, never knew before
 Like "I" before "E" except after "C"
 And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
 Now, now, now
 I'm gonna teach you
 Teach you, teach you
 All about love girl
 All about love
 Sit yourself down, take a seat
 All you gotta do is repeat after me
 Oh, A B C
 It's easy as, 1 2 3
 As simple as, do re mi
 A B C, 1 2 3
 Baby, you and me girl
 A B C it's easy,
 It's like counting up to 3
 Sing a simple melody
 That's how easy love can be
 That's how easy love can be
 Sing a simple melody
 1 2 3 baby
 You and me
 Sit down girl,
 I think I love ya'
 And all i Want you do to is Repeat After me
 Say Abc Say 123
 Say Abc Say 123
 Shake it, shake it baby, come on now
 Shake it, shake it baby, oooh, oooh
 Shake it, shake it baby, yeah
 1 2 3 baby, oooh oooh
 A B C baby, ah, ah
 Do re mi baby, wow
 That's how easy love can be
 A B C it's easy
 It's like counting up to 3
 Sing a simple melody
 That's how easy love can be
 Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it!
 Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it
 Stop! The love you save may be your own!
 Darling, take it slow
 Or some day you'll be all alone.
 You'd better stop the love you save may be your own!
 Darling, look both ways before you cross me
 You're headed for the danger zone.
 Slow down.
 Slow down.
 Slow down.
 Slow down.
 S is for "Save it"
 T is for "Take it slow"
 O is for "Oh, no!"
 P is for "Please, please, don't go!"
