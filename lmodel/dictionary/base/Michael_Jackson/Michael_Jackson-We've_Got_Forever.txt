<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="We've_Got_Forever">
(We've got forever, forever)
I'll plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
We shall have music
We shal have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time
Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
&lt;ad lib to fade&gt;
