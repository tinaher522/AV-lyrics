(INTRO TO SONG .. real version doesn't have intro)
"You could ask yourself the question, 
Do I feel lucky? 
Well do ya punk?"
(cock of a gun an Gunshot sound) Beat drops, horns sound
(Over a loud speaker) Ladies and gentlemen EAK (man)
(VERSE ONE)
Father comes home from work and he's scared to death
Mother cries out again, it's no charade (or mothers in the kitchen he knows she read)
Father runs to the table, he says what's going on 
Mother cries desperately, our little baby's gone
(CHORUS 1)
Do you know where your children are? 
Because it's not 12 O'clock,
And they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are? 
Because it's not 12 O'clock,
And they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are.
(VERSE 2)
She wrote that she is tired of step-daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive? She ain't got nothing to eat!
(CHORUS 2)
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's not 12 O'clock,
And they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are,
Do you know where your children, children, children, children, children, children, children, children...
(JAY-Z) Maintain'in is the same old thing,
A Little Stress, a little (inaudible) aint too much change.
I see you kept it movin'
You see I kept improvin' (or kept it groovin')
She Know that I had an agreement,
Remember when I used to walk up and down the Sceneit Uh huh.
Put it down, through the streets
Is watchin State hood it down,
Just had it (inaudible)
What good is it now?. 
(MICHAEL) 
Do you know where your children are? 
Because it's not 12 O'clock,
And they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are.
Do you know where your children are? 
Because it's not 12 O'clock, 
And they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are.
( Save Me (8x's and adlibs) until guitar solo)
Save me from this livin' hell,
Save me, cause that I'm gonna do
Save me, I'm tired and unfed
Save me, cause this because of you (Hoo)
Save me, cause I'm on the bed
Save me, cause I don't want no more
Save me, cause terror arrived
Save me!
(Guitar Solo 20 seconds long)
(VERSE 3)
Now she on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there 
I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard 
She's sell her body ha girl that will take you far
The police come around the corner, somebody up there told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old
Last Chorus and adlibs in between:
Do you know where your children are?  
Because it's not 12 O'clock,
And they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are.  (REPEATS 6x's until 4:33)
(VERSE ONE REPEATS)
Father comes home from work and he's scared to death
Mother cries out again, it's no charade
Father runs to the table, he says what's going on (Gunshot fires off)
