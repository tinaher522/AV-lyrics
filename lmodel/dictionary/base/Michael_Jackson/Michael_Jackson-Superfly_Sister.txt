A shoo-heh
Oooh
Hee hee
A shoo
A shoo-heh
Woh
A shoo-heh
Woh
Hee
Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
He wanna do somethin' freaky to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl
He wanna shake it up, shake it down
Doin' it right
He wanna jump back, half flap, doin' it right
He wanna lay you down
Turn it up
Kickin' it loose
He wanna fly high, nigh high
Baby for you's
He wanna motormouth
Float around
Baby the back
He wanna shake it up, shake it down
Moving rou-ha-hound
Love ain't what it used to be (hee)
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about (woh)
Susie like to agitate
Get the boy and make him wait
Mother's preaching Abraham
Brothers they don't give a damn
He wanna do something freaky to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl
He wanna do it up, make it hot
Deep in the night
He wanna eyeball
Get all
Playin' it right
He wanna turn the key
Work the sheets
Groove to the left
He wanna hot stuff
Hot love
Making it wet
He wanna give hot, jump shot
Groove to the left
He wanna time bump
Slam dunk, hump, hump, hump
Hoo
Hee (Keep it goin')
Party down
Hoo
Hoo
Love ain't what it used to be (hoo)
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
Sister say she love him some
(She's doin' it, she's doin' it)
Got his jimmy on the run
(hoo hoo)
Mother's preaching Abraham
(hoo)
Brothers they don't give a damn

Johnny's begging pretty please
Keep the brother on his knees (Keep the brother on his knees)

Susie likes to agitate
(She's doin' it, she's doin' it)
Get the boy and make him wait

Sister's married to her hood
Sayin' that she got it good
Holy Mary Mercy me
(hee)
Can't believe the things I see
Thinkin' that they got it great
(hoo)
They doin' what they used to hate
(uh)
Push it in, stick it out
(She doin' it)
(She doin' it)
That ain't what it's all about
That ain't what it's all about
Holy Mary Mercy me
(She's holy moly moly Mary)
Can't believe the things I see
(Little things I see)
(hee hee)
Mother's preaching Abraham

Talk a little something, then close your eyes
I gotta make her, close the door

(Party down)
Holy Mary mercy me

Can't believe the things I see
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
