<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="You_Are_My_Life">
Once all alone 
I was lost in a world of strangers 
No one to trust 
On my own, I was lonely 
You suddenly appeared 
It was cloudy before but now it's all clear 
You took away the fear 
You brought me back to light
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars (Stars)
That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart)
You're my daytime my night time 
My world 
You are my life... You are my life... 
Now I wake up everyday 
With this smile upon my face 
No more tears, no more pain 
Cause you love me 
You help me understand 
That love is the answer to all that I am 
And I'm a better man 
Since you taught me by sharing your life 
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars (Stars)
That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart)
You're my daytime my night time 
My world 
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars (Stars)
That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart)
You're my daytime my night time 
My world 
You gave me strength 
When I wasn't strong (I wasn't strong...) 
You gave me hope when all hope is lost 
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see (I couldn't see....)
Love was always here waiting for me, me~
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars (Stars)
That (that) twinkle at night (twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart)
You're my daytime my night time 
My world 
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars (More like the stars)
That (that) twinkle (the night time) at night (twinkle at night) (I love you)
You are the moon (Alright, now)
(You are the sun) That glows in my heart 
You're my daytime my night time 
My world 
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars (More like the stars)
That (that) twinkle (the night time) at night (twinkle at night) (I love you)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (That glows in my heart)
You're my daytime my night time 
My world 
You are my life
