<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="This_Is_It">
Ready?
1, 2, 3, 4
This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, I'll feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know, yes for sure, it is real
And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes
But you say you're gonna leave it for yourself
Oh
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand
This is it I can say
I'm the light of your world, run away
We can feel This is real
Every time I'm in love that I feel
And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me that you don't want me hanging around
Many times wanna do it here before
Oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand
This is it, I can feel
I'm the light of the world, this is real
Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you can feel that way
And I feels as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you saw my face yourself
And you said want to go with you on a while
And I know that it's really for myself
Oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on please dear understand
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on dear please understand
