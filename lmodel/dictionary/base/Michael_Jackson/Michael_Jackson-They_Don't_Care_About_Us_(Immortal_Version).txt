<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="They_Don't_Care_About_Us_(Immortal_Version)">
Skin head
 Dead head
 Everybody
 Gone bad
 Situation
 Aggravation
 Everybody
 Allegation
 In the suite
 On the news
 Everybody
 Dog food
 Bang bang
 Shock dead
 Everybody's
 Gone mad
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about us
 All I wanna say is that 
 They don't really care about us
 Beat me
 Hate me
 You can never
 Break me
 Will me
 Thrill me
 You can never 
 Kill me
 ...
 Sue me
 Everybody
 Do me
 Kick me
 ...
 Don't you
 Black or white me
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about us
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about us
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about us
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about us
 Some things in life they just don't wanna see
 But if Martin Luther was living
 He wouldn't let this be, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 They don't care about us
 All I wanna say is that
 They don't really care about us
