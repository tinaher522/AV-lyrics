<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="They_Don't_Care_About_Us">
Children :
Yeah!
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
(Don't worry people say, we got a true!)
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black or white me
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I'm a victim of police brutality, no (Hee!)
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate,
You're rapin' me of my pride
Oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy…
Set me free
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Black man, black mail
Throw the brother in jail
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, no (Hee!)
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
You're throwin' me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no.
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us'
Oow!
Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Skin head, dead head
Everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation (Hoo, hoo!)
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news (Hoo, hoo!)
Everybody dog food
Kick me, kike me
Don't you wrong or right me
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us' (Hoo, hoo!)
All I wanna say is that,
'They don't really care about us' (Hoo, hoo!)
All I wanna say is that, (Hee!)
'They don't really care about us'
All I wanna say is that, (Hoo, hoo!)
'They don't really care about…'
All I wanna say is that, (Hoo, hoo!)
'They don't really care about…'
All I wanna say is that, (Hoo, hoo, Hee!)
'They don't really care about us'
Hee, hee!
Hoo, hoo!
