<song artist="Michael_Jackson" title="Smooth_Criminal">
As he came into the window
Was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you
A crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal
Aaow!
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations
Annie are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?)
So, Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?)
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?)
So, Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?)
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you
A crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A smooth criminal
Aaow!
Ok, I want everybody to clear the area right now
Aaow!
Annie are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sign in the window, (I don't know)
That he struck you
A crescendo Annie (I don't know)
He came into your apartment, (I don't know)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why babe)
Then you ran into the bedroom,  (I don't know)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dad gone it Annie)
Annie are you okay? (Dad gone it Annie)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dad gone it baby)
There's a sign in the window, (Dad gone it Annie)
That he struck you, (Hoo!)
A crescendo Annie (Hoo!)
He came into your apartment, (Dad gone it)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet (Hoo!)
Then you ran into the bedroom, (Hoo! Hoo!)
You were struck down (Dad gone it!)
It was your doom, Annie
(D-aow!)
And now I'm all alone again
Nowhere to turn, no one to go to
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face to say hello to
And now the night is near
Now I can make believe he's here
 
Sometimes I walk alone at night
When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head
