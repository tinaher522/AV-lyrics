<song artist="Zayn" title="Borderz">
She is the life of the party
Don't stick that knife in my body
It's something she always wanted
It's for a good cause
You're doing a good job
We're off where the wind blows
I don't care where we go
Just like the ocean
You change what I see
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion
All because of me
So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So lets cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
Guilty for insanity
Not like a movie
Change the scene
Taste your sweet profanity
This is all for a good cause
Think you're doing a good job
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion
All because of me
So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So let's cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(you were right on border)
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
No falling in
Don't need no proof
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
No falling in
Don't need no proof
So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So lets cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(you were right on border)
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(you were right on border)
