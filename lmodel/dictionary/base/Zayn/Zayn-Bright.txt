<song artist="Zayn" title="Bright">
I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd
I'm loving the colorway
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you
For the love in my mind
Love for the bass
She likes getting high just for the day
She's different in night, she knows what I say
Free of the flash, dirt on your shoes
I don't know you
I'm loving the colorway
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you...
