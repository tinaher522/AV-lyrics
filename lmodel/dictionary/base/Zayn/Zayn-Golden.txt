<song artist="Zayn" title="Golden">
It goes and it's golden like sands of time
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be
Every single jigsaw piece
Seems to be incomplete
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
It goes and it's golden like sands of time
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright
Look through the light and see, it's meant to be
Every single jigsaw piece
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
'Cause it grows and it grows
And I hope that you know
'Cause it grows and it grows
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
