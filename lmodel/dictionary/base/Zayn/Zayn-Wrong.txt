<song artist="Zayn" title="Wrong">
Oh when I, in the same light
Show me in the same light
Feels right, come and take flight
Clothes off and she so soft
This ain’t a fair fight, yeah
What a shared love
Only so dry
I'll get her wetter than ever
Four letters is never the question
She likes when I’m messy
And I like when she’s undressing
You’re looking in the wrong place for my love
Don’t think because you’re with me this is real
You’re looking in the wrong place for my love
Don’t stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too
Here with you ‘cause you got the right vibe
Seems like you probably gotta do mine
But it’s gotta be the right time
We’re only good for the night time
I see through your demeanor
Baby I’m a pleaser
I go out my way to treat you
But I can’t be a teacher
'Cause I’m a problem with problems
I know who I am and I’m not no good
You can have me tonight and ever
I thought you understood
Baby some people are meant to be loved and others just naked
So take what I'm willing to give and love it or hate it
You’re looking in the wrong place for my love
Don’t think because you’re with me this is real
You’re looking in the wrong place for my love
Don’t stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too
I don't, I don't really know
I don't, I don't really care
Maybe keep it on the low
With stories I don't wanna share
(Don't stop)
You’re looking in the wrong place for my love
Don’t think because you’re with me this is real
You’re looking in the wrong place for my love
Don’t stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too
