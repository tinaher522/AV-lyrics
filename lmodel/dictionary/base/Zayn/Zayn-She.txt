<song artist="Zayn" title="She">
She puts her spirit in a nightcap
She always knows where the crowd's at
She puts her mouth round the cigarette
I put it out 'cause she likes that
She always dances when it's raining
"Aye, when's it starting baby?"
She looks at me like she's waiting
Making time go slow when they show her the table
Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To kiss her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She's crying out that she loves me
Holding my hands so I won't leave
'Cause baby don't wanna be lonely
She says "I just want you to hold me"
Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To kiss her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
In the right way
In the right way
In the right way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong, in the right way
In the right way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong, in the right way
In the wrong way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong, in the right way
In the wrong way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong
She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To kiss her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
