<song artist="Zayn" title="Mind_Of_Mindd_(Intro)">
Now that I'm on the edge
I can't find my way
It's inside of my mind of mine
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Now that I'm on the edge
I can't find my way
It's inside of my mind of mine
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
