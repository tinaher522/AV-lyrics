<song artist="Zayn" title="Truth">
My luck's on the game
Can't find a way through
Don't know how many times
I had to say this to you
This ain't my scene
This wasn't my dream
It was all yours
And of course
I got caught up in this game
And you know I won't say names
Of who's to blame
I won’t point any fingers
I won’t say it was you
I'll let life take its time
Any time you'll see the truth
I won't ask any questions
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time
Any time you'll see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
My own mind was in the way
Front seat, new view
Don't know how many times
I've had to talk you through
My dreams, new scenes with enemies
I got caught up in this game
A game
I won’t point any fingers
I won’t say it was you
I'll let life take it's time
Any time you'll see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
I tried
Hide it all
Don't try, don't try
Don't try, hide it all
Don't try to hide it all
Don't try, don't try
Don't try, hide it all up
I won’t point any fingers
I won’t say it was you
I'll let life take it's time
Any time you'll see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
