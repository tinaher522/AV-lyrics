Yeah
Take ya'll back .... to them school days, yeah.
Fayettenam, what up, man?
We came a long way from sticking move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, its a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food,
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parl
