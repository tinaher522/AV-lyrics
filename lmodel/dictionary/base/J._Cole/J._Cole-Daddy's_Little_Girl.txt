[Verse 1]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble?
Just because they fuck yo' girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up."
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up."
She said "Daddy, what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
[Hook]
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
[Verse 2]
Can I get a witness, this is Shawty mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so then roll it up,
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
[Hook]
Hey, and blow a couple stacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
