[Verse 1]
My man Shawn from around the way son been down from day one
Never been known for mistakes but was bound to make one
Her name was Nina
See he was all about the cash flow
'Til she came and had this man pussy whipped to the max yo
A true dime piece describing her
Brown eyes, caramel skin, thick thighs
Goes beyond speech
But besides looks her mind's lost
Known for kicking cats to the curb
Leaving their hearts on the sidewalk
Shawn was one of them
She said she was loving him 
But only fucked with him because he had some funds coming in
He couldn't see it though
She was cheating and he didn't even know
He even bought a crib with this female hoe
In the ride, mad jewels, mad clothes, mad shoes
And to show his commitment he got her name tattooed
I gotta hand it to her
She had the stuff planned out
But watch what happened when her luck ran out
Chorus (x2):
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm
[Verse 2]
Time passes
Shawn is thinking about wedding rings
But he knows the signs of cheating and doesn't wanna believe them
He disregards them
Goes out for diamond rings shopping
Now the big question is when is he gonna pop it
Waiting for the right time
Meanwhile Nina's the same hoe
Like a snare drum but bangs way more
For Shawn up to this point shit's going well
'Til one day his homeboy hit him on his cell, like:
"Yo son you won'te believe this, I just seen your chick."
("Where?")
"In the mall with this cat, he was palming her ass
I swear to God son
Need me to run up on him and drop him?"
"Nah, chill I got this
I'll hit you back if it's popping"
He hung up but called Nina
"Where you at? What you doing?"
"At the mall with some friends buying new Timbs."
Something sounded funny
She was lying for sure
But Shawn had a little plot of his own
Check it
Chorus:
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
Peep how he plays this whore
[Verse 3]
I missed you (Aw)
Missed you so bad I followed you (What, where?)
Followed you all the way to your boyfriend's ron de vous (What?)
Yeah bitch you caught now
So don't even try to give me that shit you thought how it wasn't you who I saw now (No it wasn't)
You trifling hoe
I gave my whole life to you yo
And now you basically shove a knife in my throat (It's not like that)
But it's alright though
The same cat you was fucking with then
Is currently laying dead in the trunk of my Benz (Oh God)
Yeah get to crying
In a minute you'll be there beside him
And by the time the cops find you I'll be in the islands (No, I'm sorry)
Visualizing what could have been between me and you
It was just just a dream
You fucked up the thing between us two
So now it's pick your piece before you leave this earth bitch (We can work this out)
I hope that shit was worth it
And now I pray that God is merciless
With this said
Goodbye to the reason I lived this life (Shawn)
Pointed the gat to her mouth
Long kiss goodnight (No)
Chorus (x2):
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm
