Uh, yeah
Uh, uh-huh,
Yeah,
I'm I-95 cruising, with the sun in my eyes,
In the south, dog, my momma ain't seen her son in awhile,
Yea, I'll sure is,
Can't wait to see my niggas and fuck with my old chicks,
Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins,
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit.
Yea, so nigga watch it!
A nigga been in NY tryna get some bigger pockets,
You still up in the ville, tryna make it in the trap,
I'm finna put us on the map; I told you I was coming back, Cuz,
Yeah, so make way, the prince of the city, ain't a street I can't stay,
You niggas is hatin,' just be happy I ain't changed.
Blunts rolled to the murk, we all want the same thing,
And that's- money to feed us, yup,
We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet Him yet, haha!
Yea, If I never..
Nigga, man,
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga,
Cuz uh,
Na na na
Now Imma always come home,
Its where a nigga was grown,
Where a nigga was shown,
How to scrap, yup,
Shown how to mack, yup,
Sold a whole lot of crack, yup,
Juggling them hoes,
There was a whole lot of that, yup,
Momma work to the bone,
Putting clothes on my back,
I'm coming home to give everything I owe to her back, yea,
Yea,
I swear they say, man,
Yea yeah,
Shout to the whole ville!
Of course, so real!
Uh,
If I never...
If I never went home again,
"Hello?, chill out nigga, what's up, boy?
Yeah, I just touched down man,
I'm over off Ramsey and shit,
Aiight, well look,

What's jumping for tonight?
Oh the Live? I'm in there, nigga.
