<song artist="J._Cole" title="House_Of_Blues">
N-gga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won't get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I'm a wizard, I'm a don and I put this on my mom
I'm offended, I'm appalled
If y'all ain't bowing
Claim you a monster but y'all aint growling
Claim you a beast, why y'all aint howling?
'Bout as sweet as a jumper on the game Ray Allen
I'm 'bout f-cking hoes like Ray J wylin'
Killin' n-ggas like K K K violence
I guess it why they pay homage
Momma I'mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
