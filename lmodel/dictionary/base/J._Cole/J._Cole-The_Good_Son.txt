<song artist="J._Cole" title="The_Good_Son">
Allow me to set the scene first
This little nigga no older than seventeen in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walkin' down the mean murk, where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt'll find a nigga
Even if you tryna get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smirk, he smiled back
He remembered this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialed back
How niggas do, he kept it movin', couldn't wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn't wait to get shown
Straight A's as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he'd get her out for good
That made him smile
The favourite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn't wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn't wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he's fading out, her favourie child
He's fading out
