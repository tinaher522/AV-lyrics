Summer after high school when we first met
We make up in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th Birthday
We got that chain tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor
And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue
Never plan that one day
I'd be loosing you
And in another life
I would be your girl
We keep for of promises
Be us against the world
And in other life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was dreaming you were my Johnny Cash
Never one we got the other We made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the Booms
Its time to face the music
I longer amused
And in another life
I would be your girl
We keep full of promises
Be us against the world
And in another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one o o o o
The one o o o o
The one o o o o
The one that got away
Bridge:
All these money can't buy me a time machine (No o o o)
Can't replace you with a million rings (No o o o)
Shoulda told you what you meant to me (WO o o o)
Cause now I pay the price
And in another life
I would be your girl
We keep for of promises
Be us against the world
And in another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one o o o o
The one o o o o
The one o o o o
And in another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
