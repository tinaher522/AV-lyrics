<song artist="J._Cole" title="Mr._Nice_Watch">
Yeah, everybody got a bad side
Drop, let me see that shit
What you say Cole ain't hot? What!
Where you read that shit?
You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit
Have you seen my shows, have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting at, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me boy, I'm red hot
Umm nigga, they not,
I'm over here, I'm over there
I'm everywhere they not
(I said)
You'll never play me, nice try
Ballin' in the night spot
No more Mr Nice guy, hello Mr Nice watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot so
You can look but don't touch
I'll stay on my toes like them White Sox
[Hook:]
Cause it cost me a lot
My chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can make that back so
Let's ball while we here
Let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it I'll make that back
Go
Nice watch
Nice watch (I know)
Nice watch
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high roller
Now it's racks on racks
Never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World but I'm hot as shit
Do that mean that I'm Bi-polar?
Young black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas eve
Coach wouldn't let him off the bench, no wonder why they quit the team
But, I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World so the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please
I gotta make history
[Hook:]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back so
Let's ball while we here
Let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it I'll make that back
Go
Nice watch
Nice watch (I know)
Nice watch
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch
[Jay-Z:]
I got a Hublot I call it Tebow
I strap that bitch with a Gator band
Y'all niggas ball half time ya'll niggas like the gator band
Y'all niggas need a timeout, who got these niggas all wind up
Cocksucka I'm 7.30, y'all know where you'll niggas gon wind up
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit ya'll niggas with the nice shot
Y'all niggas, better not call the law
Get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning ya'll better not waste my time
When y'all ready I'll take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors
Put the front on the back cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss
So I fronting on niggas when I'm backing off
Uh, what up Cole, It's your time
Let these niggas know
Adjust ya Roley's on these muthafucking hoes
Whenever you ready, go!
[Hook:]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
If we ever go broke, girl, then time is all we got
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
