<song artist="J._Cole" title="I_Get_Up">
Ha-yea
Carolina stand Up!! (humming)
Im good to go yo, yea
I woke up early in the morning hoes blowing up my phone
Aint no use for small talking when they know Im trynna bone, fuck em'
I holla "lata;" man right now my minds else where
My moms healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail nigga wont prevail here
We seen it all men niggas cant even spell "scared"
A fresh prince  but yo my city aint no Bel-Air
Fuck if you excel Im worried bout' my welfare
So farewell  to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
So as my doe strait I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window hope the sun shining down on the niggas out there frontlin'n
I hit the street and seem them boys out there locking up some older heads
Said "God damn homie hold your head" and hold your head
Chorus
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though
Until the top if I climb my way, and tell em' imma rise
I'm on my -headin for the sky-im on my way
Verse Two
Yea paint a picture and show the deaf what its like to listen
And speak the words and tell the blind man what he missing
For all my niggas doing time man up in prison
Thought you had to resort to crime man fuck the system!
We raising babies up in Haiti where there aint no hope
Aint no fathers don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollern' bout problems but I aint gon' vote
Keep talking bout' change til we floating in the same old boat
So tell me how Im supposed to feel what the president spoke-never-
We he aint never had to struggle aint never been broke-never-
Aint even rode through the ghetto aint never been close-never-
Trusting this government like trusting the devil in oath
A rebel with quotes- I Get Up!-
Lifestyles of the young, black and wreckless
A generation of niggas strapped and asking questions
Like, "Tell me why I aint got shit"
I let this liquors fill my liver with them toxics (as I sip)
Chorus
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though
Until the top if I climb my way, and tell em' imma rise
I'm on my -headin for the sky-im on my way
Verse Three
Yea to all my niggas paper chasing I pray for your patience-please-
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cake'n
Taking this shit one step at a time
That real shit is stuck in my mind
But to that bullshit, I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine, Imma find a way
Cuz hey, damnit these jobs out here aint trynna pay, I pray
Granted, 9 to5 is how you survive I aint trynna survive
Im trynna throw my momma in rides
Imma provide for my seed Im the soil
Ill teach em' bout loyalty
Ill teach him that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
Ill show him all the things that my pops was never showing me
Treat him like a growing tree
With this poetry I get up!
And show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seeds got tomorrow
So please niggas raise your kids
And hope them overcome that bullshit they dazed us with
I blaze this shit and-
Chorus
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way (I get up)
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way (I get up)
And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though
Until the top if I climb my way, and tell em' imma rise
I'm on my -headin for the sky-im on my way
Talking
Take em' to church nigga  (laughs)
Uh-uh-uh (bunch of Uh's)
Yea imma take em to the top!
Chorus
I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way (and Imma take em to the top!)
And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though
Until the top if I climb my way, and tell em' imma rise
I'm on my -headin for the sky-im on my way
