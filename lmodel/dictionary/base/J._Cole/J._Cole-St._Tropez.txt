<song artist="J._Cole" title="St._Tropez">
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Ay from the door I showed you my scars and I told you girl, I won't lie
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I...I... cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile
It's been hard for me to smile
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
