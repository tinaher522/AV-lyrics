<song artist="J._Cole" title="Note_To_Self">
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter
It don't matter
I don't mind 'cause you don't matter
I don't mind 'cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end
I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever
Something that's old as forever
Love
Love
Love
Love
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter
It don't matter
I don't mind 'cause you don't matter
I don't mind 'cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end
