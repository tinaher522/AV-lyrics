Below that mason dixon my residence 
Dirty south confederate
Aye we should hold elections i say bun b for president
He represent them real niggas
TX to ATL to NC yeah them ville niggas
Them trill niggas chill nigga this that rider shit
My bottom bitch say im not a bitch boy i got a bitch
I keep her ass in prada shit these rappers counterfeit
I potty train niggas yeah this that teach you how to shit
Im bout this shit
My minds a glock my mouths the clip my words is bullets im bouta spit 
I leave you leaking you lay in peace as if the streets encounter shit
You see me on my bouncer shit
Watch out i put you out this shit
Man im making so much money gotta pay somebody to count this shit
Probably gon make my accountant sick
Boy im higher then the mountains get
These new niggas aint talking bout nothing cause it obvious they aint been around this shit
So they bound to split when they go down
Profound with these pronouns 
Ladies loving J. Cole now so you better not bring yo hoe round
You know the residence 
Dirty south confederate
Aye we should elections i say bun b for president 
He represent them real niggas
TX to ATL to NC yeah them ville niggas
Them trill niggas heyyyyy.....
