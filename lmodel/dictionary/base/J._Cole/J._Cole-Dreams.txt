<song artist="J._Cole" title="Dreams">
Yea, huh, yo, You gotta list- you gotta follow me what im doing right
Heerree man
Like, when I say this shit is crazy, I don't mean its crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it fucking its actually crazy
You know what I mean? Yea
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait,
Is fate procrastinating?
I cant take it 'cause I might be right,
Chorus
This is the girl of my dreams
Ay, is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Ay, should I try and get some help?
(repeat 2x)
Verse 2
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her like all the way home
Without her knowing
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occasionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she wave at me,
Imagine what she'll say to me, this ain't no time to be afraid no more
It's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy,
(Chorus)
Verse 3
Look, I spot her walking in the mall,
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my god, I'm walking towards her
My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you coming for her
My heartbeat racing, and my hands keep shaking
Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's waiting,
"Wassup girl, don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women
But you from my dreams, ay will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch, some R&amp;B and rap, ay you should
Come through"
She said, "Uh, I love to, except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would
Like that"
*Damn*
"Okay, you say you got a man, I mean, I definitely understand,
I'm happy for you, really am, I couldn't of been the only fan
In the world Of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm gon' see you around the city
Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for y'all, then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene"
I came up with a world-class scheme to get the-
(Chorus)
Verse 4
So I find out the nigga name, know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work, hold up nigga, is you sane?
Imma follow in my car; Imma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall, maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time, then console her while she crying
She gon' take that as a sign; finally she will be mine!
I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit her with ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing? 
Chorus
