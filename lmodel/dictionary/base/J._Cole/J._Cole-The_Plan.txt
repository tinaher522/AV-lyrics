(Hook)
One time for the plan
Straight to the top I got the power in my hands yeah
Live for the moment be high
Act like you want it reach out
No we aint on but we try
Now holla back and reply
(Verse 1)
Feel like i live for this moment 
I see it in they eyes
Them other n*ggas dont want it
My style they can crown it
But cant dethrone it
I was aiming for the top
And now i am on it
With a powerful performance
I was in my zone
Send flowers for opponents
Tell em get well soon
Cuz i aint in the mood
If you read that word backwards 
Then it should spell doom
Am on fire
Yall can inhale fumes
As i zoom by ya
Ask ya nigga,whose higher
Fueled by a desire you should admire
Thats why am what they aspire to be before they retire
Uh a living legend with god given blessings
With a game so cold 
They probably watching this in heaven
Expecting the incredible
So baby watch me do that
Uh and make the angels say lord how he do that?
Hook (*2)
Lalalalala lalala lalalaaa
(verse 2)
A champions metality 
And so am scoring ignoring the fact you fouling me
And one
Where i go you cant come
I was schooling your father boy 
That makes you my grandson
Uh i been around the block twice
Now my shots nice
No referee but best believe out here i got stripes
Now that they must consider me a legit scorer
Can you believe i started out as a bench warmer
Have me feelling like master splinter
Now the haters and commentators say thats a winner
Hey hard work pay off
Nah i dont take a day off
I rest not
I bet thats why your best shot way off
These are the things that drems are made of ,its sweet 
No time for sleep when you elite
If what you reap is what you sow 
Then what was you expecting?
Except for comming second
While i become a legend
Hook (*2)
Lalalalala lalala lalalaaa
Why dont you reach for the sky?
Oh you dont believe you can fly
I guess ill see you when you get there
I guess ill see you when you get there (*2)
