<song artist="J._Cole" title="The_Autograph">
They say anythings possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can hoe
They try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don't you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man
I'm on these rich niggas ass no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Silly head to approach, whats up young blood
Aint it strange, a year ago today I was counting change
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city
Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me
Than I surely woulda died
You can throw the fork in me
This my New Years resolution, dawg
No more Pork in me
Uh, I aint no Muslim though
Kuran butler I'm a wizard if he doesnt know
Its young Simba, I'm ballin' til the buzzard blow
You try and kick the shit I kick you gon stub your toe
Boy thats just how tough I go
See this is my life work
This shit you callin classic, I be like that mic work
Want you to feel something new, thats how a dike work
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst
Not tonight nigga
Not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Hey, man, hey
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma, momma who don't like me
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me
I hit her til she snooze, like the news nigga nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
No she bitter with this nigga
Cause he aint quite me
One things for certain baby, you are a wifey
Two things for fucking sure
I am not the husband thoguh
So run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah thats a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interupt something real, damn
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn't say that you a hoe, just made a hoe decision
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions
We both know thats what you wanted girl
I know you listening
Hey
Girl I know you listening
Uh I know you listening
Hey, yeah
Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online trying to find my shit
And to theniggas listening but wont buy my shit
And catch me in the street wanna ride my dick
Y'all niggas is the worst, see me like
"J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD"
Nigga please, an album ten dollars
You act like it's ten g's
This food for thought cost the same as 2 numbers three's
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel ya pain, thats why I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh shit
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and a whole lot more shit
Than got richer and still rapping like I'm poor shit
You niggas thinnk you know shit, nigga you don't know shit
Hoe bitch
Yeah, Cole Bitch
J Cole nigga
Hey
