Hey, hey, yea, yea
Got a dolla and a dream
Yea
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Yea
I got a dolla and a dream, hey
[clears throat]
Ay, I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Niggas hatin' but I love them even though they trynna scheme
But I'm past that, a niggas stock is raising like the Nastec
They same I'm the future but yet I'm giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days, when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga I say what they never say
Whenever they, spit that bullshit they spittin,
This that pool pit I'm hittin niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dolla in my pocket, plus a dream
Yea you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I'll tell you what them scares like
I'm speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of sifting through my mails I feel like Cartwright, bills
Forreal, a nigga I'll
Just let me do the talking men I know how niggas feel
[Chorus:]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
[4x]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Every lady ain't no hoe, and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog, and every nigga ain't no king
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, so white man can jump
They shooting niggas fo' they even tell em put their hands up!
Crooked cops, got a nigga scared to drive probably thinking
That I'm slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dolla plus a dream
Yea you swear your girl is faithful everything ain't what it seems
See I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'm a fuck her but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worst
I bet if I was to hit men, I wouldn't be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get from the Bible, for your survival
[Chorus:]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
[4x]
Check it
Ay Salle, I know I ain't been answering your calls, but shit, let me explain-
It's because times been hard, been runnin around trynna find a job
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o'clock
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore
I still got cha letters laying in my dresser draw
You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me doe and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you,
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time, a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks
And I know one day in my heart that I'm gonna pay you back"
I got a dolla and a dream
