[Intro]
Hey I got a dolla in a dream
But its all a n-gga got so its about that green
And im all up in that spot
Hey
[Verse 1]
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I thinked about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I neva had
Waving gats instead of flags the American dream
Why do we cling to the villians?
Knowing they killin'
My n-ggas high enough to swaing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my whole book
Still the screams from girls shot and killed fill my head on a daily
At times I question God can you blame me they can't tame me?
My voice screech through the street Im a beast on em
Oh no he will not fold you will not see a priest on him
He will not slip or lose his grip they got them cleats on em
But never will he run unless you call police on em
[Chorus]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a n-gga though
I said Its two sides to a n-gga yo
Ey look sometimes im feeling high
Then im feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a n-gga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a n-gga yo yo yo
[Verse 2]
Yeah some pussy n-ggas put out on me and my mans
Wasn't for the pistol we drop em right there where he stands
But still we never ran foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then the hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil n-ggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nose ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gatts came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn't trying to be cool its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch i,ll annihilate him
Im tired of wait on my ticket out this mothaf-cka
Hope they don't kill me before I get up out this mothaf-cka
I gotta go,
Now can I be that n-gga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the f-ck am I here God?
That n-gga died why the f-ck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Though it blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my n-ggas feel this shit
How could I f-ck her raw? And I just met the hoe
My dick took over it aint never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I'm so alert, riding down 95
Naw I aint finna to go to work
I'm headed back home aint staying that long
I'm chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I'm paying dues that a n-gga paying tax on
Im tryina blow like a n-gga playing saxophone
Im playing daddy to another n-ggas daughter
Don't worry even Jesus never saw his real father
I don't bother me at all though
Yeah say it don't bother me
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I cant wait to sing this song I be like, I be like
[Outro]
Hey don't cry hey ohh no
We aint gotta worry bout the money no more
We aint gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We aint gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don't cry hey ohh no
We aint gotta worry bout the money no more
We aint gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We aint gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey
