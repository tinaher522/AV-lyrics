<song artist="J._Cole" title="Welcome">
Im sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain
Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind trynna figure where these twenty G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought I think I need to speed it up and make more
Time to build, lego
In the Ville' laid low, counting days still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate-hold up, I gotta call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? I swear this city too small
Type of chick wont take her shirt off cuz' her tities too small
I can give a damn girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in it deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, Im up in that, got that type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that
At the door with a towel on and nothing under that, saying "Welcome"
Verse 2
I let these words flow out, like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowds
Cuz' these words go deep, from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hits the souls of all those that I reach
If I die before I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when Im gone?- And if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thought sometimes wonder if Im sane
Man, its hard to trust friends, when the paranoia blends with the marijuana
Wonder would this high ever end
Swear I never smoke again, ya'll niggas blow the weed, let me take another shot, Man this liquor is all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me got me feeling so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingering in my dome
I tell em' aint nothing wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own.
