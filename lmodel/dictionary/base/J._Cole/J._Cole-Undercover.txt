<song artist="J._Cole" title="Undercover">
I ain't gonna lie, I'm fiendin' cause I need it
And I'm diggin you a lot, now you still catching feelings
But I'm feeling on your spot, no kidding when I hit it
I be leaking on your spine, playing with your mind
I ain't gonna stop when I finish, I be in it
I be fucking with the lights on, that's the shit that I'm on
Give it all I got, your body and my body
We be feelin', scratchin', screamin'
(Hey shawty)
Here we go in (Ay)
Nobody doesn't know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover cover cover cover
(Hey shawty)
Here we go in (Ay)
Nobody doesn't know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover cover cover cover
One thing you should know about me is I never play to lose
Always aim high and rarely obey the rules
Never tell my business, if I did, it'd make the news
They say time is like money, you should come here pay your dues
And come and kick, can I get a minute, maybe an hour
Would you let me peek my head in for a second while you shower
I bet you got some real good power if you feel me
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, you know just whats gon heal me, baby
(Hey shawty)
Here we go in (Ay)
Nobody doesn't know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover cover cover cover
(Hey shawty)
Here we go in (Ay)
Nobody doesn't know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you

I said excuse me, Mrs Officer can you go undercover for me
Ain't enough liquor in your cup, let the waitress in then let her pour it, up
I'm tryna get you drunk as fuck, take her to my crib then I lock her in them handcuffs
Panties off, stupid booty, ready for war: Call Of Duty
She said I got the right to remain silent
And I gotta give it to her rough but I better not get violent, hah
Girl my chain feel like an anchor
And when I told you to use your head I ain't want you to be no thinker
And we ain't gon' waist this drink up, these haters all like hankers
While I'm countin' all this paper, and my ears shine like twinkle
Big star, get my car, I valet that
You're weak nigga, pussy in the street cause you're alley cat
And I'm loyal to my fans cause I love 'em
So girl if you a fan, you can meet me undercover like
(Hey shawty)
Here we go in (Ay)
Nobody doesn't know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover cover cover cover
(Hey shawty)
Here we go in (Ay)
Nobody doesn't know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
