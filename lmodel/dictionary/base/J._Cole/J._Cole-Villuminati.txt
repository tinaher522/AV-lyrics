<song artist="J._Cole" title="Villuminati">
It's way darker this time
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough
Look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers trying to steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet
I'm real life hot
Homie, get your weight up
Fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay faggot
Don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya
Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James
Wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck
If the hoes like it
I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I be all up in the city
Trying to get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it
It was, fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know
In a year he'd be fucking paying me
What can you say to me
I beat the odds like Vegas
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young Black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free
Pardon me
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
I'm prince of the city
I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
So I'm wondering really
What could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry
Fuck the education
Would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in him
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul
My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
This next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga
Young Black millionaire
Old White billionaires
I'm sure that they could do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma laude
Beyonce told me that she want to cop a blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth
I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars
Re-adjusted my target audience
Cause it's obvious
I've gone astray
Losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timberland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind
Just the sound of my whole career
Crashing burning
The thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here
Mask my tears, but I
My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
