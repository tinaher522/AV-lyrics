<song artist="J._Cole" title="Simba">
Straight out The Villle and I made it,
Like a villian I'm hated
I see'em gillin, I ate it though
Fien'n to blow inflatable, That's undebatable (ugh)
I'm givin niggas food for thought, the flow is cater yo
I'm never faded though,
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the doe related hoe!
It's like my only son, where I go, he come!
Niggas dumb to be braggin bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin like the light-skin version of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised
That's word to everything!
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin
You sucka nigga lie in everything that ya sayin
Shame on ya'll, you tryna ball with the game on pause
Ay nigga pull the thing on ya'll, ya'll stain ya'll draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on ya'll
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale I excel in this rap shit,
Cause ya'll spittin that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats who made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin for the freaks and the dimes and shine like a mothafuckin diamond,
You shine like a mothafuckin dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate, I grew up with nothin, it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huckstable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzel for
Look how the buzzer grow,
Ballin til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin funny, fuck a joke I'm gettin money til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splenda
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba!
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splenda
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga: young simba!
