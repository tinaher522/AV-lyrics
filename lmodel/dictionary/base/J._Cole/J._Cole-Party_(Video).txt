You were bad girl and your friends bad too
Oh we got the swag sauce she drippin' swagu
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight,
I'll do it every way
'Cause knockin' till the morning light
'Cause we like to party, hey hey hey hey hey hey
'Cause we like to party, hey hey hey hey hey hey
'Cause we like to party
Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Tuck down with the radio on
And the night belong to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go
So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, uh uh uh, oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party
Set the scene, three thousand degrees
Ain't worried about them fuck niggas over there
But they worried 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy
That nigga named Cheese, fuck wit' me baby,
I make it milk till it drip down yo' knees
Spit this shit fo' rillo, brain brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyro
Yesterday, that's the way, every single mornin'
I try to pray grandmom 'n them, they never forgot
And nothin' else really mean nuttin' to me
I ain't stuntin' to beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you fickin' wit' me?
Move on, ain't nuttin' to see
Pssh, always somethin' to salt,
I'm the raw, off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the men
And that they fell in love with rap,
Black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due,
Cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah
So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, uh uh uh, oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party, hey hey hey hey hey hey
'Cause we like to party, hey hey hey hey hey hey
'Cause we like to party

You were bad girl and your friends bad too
