<song artist="J._Cole" title="Where's_Jermaine">
For being a precious friend
I give thanks to you
For holding our spirits high
I do thank you lord
For blessing my life each day
I give thanks to you
For always being there when all is said and done (Wooo)
To thee, do we give thanks
Now hol' on, hol' on, hol' up
Has anybody seen Jermaine? (No)
Jermaine
Where's Jermaine Cole?
