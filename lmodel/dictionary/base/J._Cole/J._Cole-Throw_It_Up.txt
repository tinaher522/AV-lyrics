<song artist="J._Cole" title="Throw_It_Up">
Yeah
Yeah, uh
Yea,
Yea
Yeah
Carolina, nigga
Fayettenam, nigga
Yea
This is for them street niggas to them deep niggas,
Them politics, them geek niggas,
To them freak bitches that swallow dick, its real.
Or them sheet niggas ain't proud of shit niggas, and still,
Even them bleak niggas without a cent could feel.
I never sleep nigga, I gotta get them mills
I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the ville.
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill.
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill.
Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third
My shit in every street, like the curb.
So bitches wanna meet cuz I'm deep with my words,
So them niggas wanna peep like a perv,
But peep game.
Before they start saying 'He changed,"
A real nigga can never forget where he came.
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game,
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train,
I throw it up!
Yea
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up,
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up,
Yeah, Chi town throw it up (yea)
As you niggas smoking more kush,
South niggas wreaking niggas, ask George Bush,
Ask Bill Clinton, a nigga Will Smithin'
My jeans a 'lil less baggy, money still fittin.'
The streets a lil less rowdy, but they still kickin'
Them Randy Johnson O.G. niggas still pitchin'
And yeah, I know she got a man, but I'm still hittin'
So when he be up in that shit, he be like 'This feels different,"
No shit, throw dick like the veteran I am,
I got that vitamin D, its like medicine to them.
I got her climaxing like it's never finna end,
That's why she fucking me a lot better than her man.
She try a new trick, she so wet a nigga swam,
Like a salmon in this bitch, my dick drowning in that shit.
They love a fly nigga on that frisbee shit.
Plus a nigga get Gs like them Disney flicks.
I throw it up!
Yea
If you a down south nigga, throw it up,
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a Bull city nigga, throw it up, (yea)
If you a H-town nigga, throw it up, (yea)
You represent that Bay nigga, throw it up, (yea)
And if you from that BK nigga, throw it up (yea)
Greedy niggas want the money, so thats where my aim is,
Hoe niggas love the attention, wanna be famous,
Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous,
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)
But thats the price when you nice with it.
And them ladies gonna like cuz you light-skinned,
I take advantage of the situation,
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania.
They catch feelings and I switch next,
"I made it clear baby, just sex,
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed!"
Even them white girls tryna be my princess,
But I only fuck with sisters like incest.
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth,
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press,
I sense death in the air, but its nothing for me,
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit.
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that shit.
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch,
You better hit up homocide, I just killed that shit, boy!
Throw it up nigga!
Throw Throw it, Throw it up!
Yeah!
