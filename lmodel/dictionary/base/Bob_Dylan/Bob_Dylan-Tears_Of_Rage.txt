<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Tears_Of_Rage">
We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day
And now you throw us all aside
And put us on our way.
Oh, what dear daughter would 'neath the sun
Would treat a father so?
To wait upon him hand and foot
Yet always answer, "No"?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone
And life is brief.
It was all pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand,
Though you just thought that it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand.
Now, I want you to know that while you watched,
You discovered there was no one true.
That I myself really thought
It was just a childish thing to do.
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone
And life is brief.
It was all very, very painless
When you ran out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe.
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse.
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone
And life is brief.
