I had a hard time waking this morning
I got a lot of things on my mind
Like those friends of yours, they keep bringing me down
Just hangin' around all the time
I've had a hard time waking most mornings
And it's been that way for a month or more
You've had things your way but now I've got to say
I'm on my way out the door
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby
You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?
Try and get right, baby
Don't you remember how it used to be?
You had a hard time waking this morning
And I can see it in your empty eyes
But there's no need for talking or walking around the block
Just to figure out the reason why
I have a hard time handing out warnings
I'll just slide on out the door
'Cuz I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful
And I ain't coming back no more
Why can't you get right, try to get right, baby
You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?
Try and get right, baby
Don't you remember how it used to be?
