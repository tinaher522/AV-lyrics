<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Pretty_Peggy-O">
I've been around this whole country
But I never yet found Fennario.
Well, as we marched down
As we marched down 
Well, as we marched down to Fennario
Well, our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove 
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O 
Well, what will your mother say
What will your mother say 
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O 
What will your mother say
To know you're going away 
You're never, never, never coming back-ioÂ ? 
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O
Come a-running down your stairs
Comb back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io. 
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O 
The lieutenant he has gone
Long gone
He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo. 
Well, our captain he is dead
Our captain he is dead 
Our captain he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O
Well, our captain he is dead
Died for a maid 
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
