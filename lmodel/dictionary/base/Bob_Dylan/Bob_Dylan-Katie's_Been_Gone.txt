<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Katie's_Been_Gone">
Katie's been gone since the spring time.
She wrote one time and sent her love.
Katie's been gone for such a long time now.
I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of.
Dear Katie, if you can hear me,
I can't wait to have you near me.
Dear Katie, since you caught that bus,
Well, I don't know how things are with us.
I'm still here and you're out there.
Katie laughed when I said I was lonely.
She said, there's no need to feel that way.
Katie said that I was her only one
But then I wonder why she didn't wanna stay.
Dear Katie, if I am the only one,
How much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, won't you tell me straight:
How much longer do I have to wait?
I believe you but please come through.
I know it's wrong to be apart this long.
You should be here, near me.
Katie's been gone and
Now her face is slowly fading from my mind.
She's gone to find some newer places,
Left the old life far behind.
Dear Katie, don't you miss your home?
I don't see why you had to roam.
Dear Katie, since you've been away
I lose a little something every day.
I need you here, but you're still out there.
Dear Katie, please drop me a line,
Just write, love, tell me you're fine.
Oh, Katie, if you can hear me,
I just can't wait to have you near me.
I can only think where are you, what you do,
May be there's someone new.
