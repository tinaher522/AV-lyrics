<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Million_Dollar_Bash">
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged
Turtle, that friend of hers with his cheques all forged
And his cheeks in a chunk with his cheese in the cash
They all wanna be there at that million dollar bash
[CHORUS]
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash
Everybody from right now to over there and back
The louder they come, the bigger they crack
Come now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash
[CHORUS]
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn
Then along came Jones, emptied the trash
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash
[CHORUS]
Well, I'm hittin' it too hard, my stones won't take
I get up in the mornin' but it's too early to wake
First it's hello, goodbye, then push and then crash
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash
[CHORUS]
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist
I punched myself in the face with my fist
I took my potatoes down to be mashed
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash
[CHORUS]
