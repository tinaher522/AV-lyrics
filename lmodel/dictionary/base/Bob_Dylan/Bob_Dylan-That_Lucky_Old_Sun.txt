<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="That_Lucky_Old_Sun">
Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lord above, can't you see I'm pining
Tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Oh Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
