<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Meet_Me_In_The_Morning">
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Honey, we could be in Kansas
By time the snow begins to thaw.
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
Honey you wouldn't know it by me
Every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind
Well, I feel just like that rooster
Honey, ya treat me so unkind.
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, you know I even outrun the hound dogs
Honey, you know I've earned your love.
Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
Ain't that just like my heart, babe
When you kissed my lips?
