<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Temporary_Like_Achilles">
Standing on your window, honey, yes, I've been here before
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door
How come you don't send me no regards?
You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard?
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling, yes, I guess I've been here for a while
I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard?
Like a poor fool in his prime
Yes, I know you can hear me walk
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime
Or is it just solid rock?
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door
I watch upon your scorpion who crawls across your circus floor
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry, like a man in drag
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard
