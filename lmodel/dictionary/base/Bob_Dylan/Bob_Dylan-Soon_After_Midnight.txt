<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Soon_After_Midnight">
I'm searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun
A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye
My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours
Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen
They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They lie and dine in their blood
Two-timing Slim
Who's every heard of him?
I'll drag his corpse through the mud
It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn't think you would do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you
