<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Spanish_Is_The_Loving_Tongue">
Broke my heart, lost my soul
Adios,mi corazon
Spanish is the loving tongue
Soft as music, light as spray
It was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Well, I don't look much like a lover
Still I say her love words over
Mostly when I'm all alone
Mi amor, mi corazon.
Haven't seen her since that night
I can't cross the line you know
They want me for a gamblin' fight
Like as not it's better so
Still I always kind of missed her
Since that last sad night I kissed her
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi corazon
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi corazon
Adios, mi corazon
Adios, mi corazon
