<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Pledging_My_Time">
Well, early in the morning to late at night
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too
Well, the hobo got too high and he came to me naturally
He stole my baby, then he wanted to steal me
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too
Won't you come with me, baby, I'll take you where you wanna go
And if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too
Well, the room is so stuffy I can hardly breathe
Everybody's gone but me and you, and I can't be the last to leave
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too
Well, they sent for the ambulance, then one was sent
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too
