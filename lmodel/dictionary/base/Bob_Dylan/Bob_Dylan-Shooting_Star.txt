<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Shooting_Star">
Seen a shootin' star tonight
And I thought of you
You're tryin' to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kinda wondered 
If you ever made it through
Seen a shootin' star tonight
And I thought of you
Seen a shootin' star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became
What you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark
Overstep the line
That only you could see
Seen a shootin' star tonight
And I thought of me
Listen for the engine
Listen fir the bell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Goes rollin' by
All good people are prayin'
It's the last temptation
The last account
Last time you might hear
The sermon on the mount
Last Radio is playin'
Seen a shootin' star tonight
Slip away
Tommorow will be
Another day
Guess it's too late to say the things to you
You needed to hear me say
Seen a shootin' star tonight
Slip away
