<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Melancholy_Mood">
Melancholy mood forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I
Stranded high and dry by a melancholy mood
Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show, no consolation
All I can see is grief and gloom
Till the crack of doom, oh melancholy mood
Deep in the night I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
But love is a whimsy and flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space
Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains
The chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free
Bring her back to me, oh melancholy mood
