<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="I_Don't_Believe_You">
I can't understand, she let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall
I'd sure like to know why she did go
But I can't get close to her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here
She acts like we never met
It's all new to me, like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it's hard to think on that she's the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock her voice once and talk
'Stead of acting like we never met
If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt she seems too far out
For me to return to or chase
Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed, for she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess
To anything I might have tried
If I was with her too long or I've done something wrong
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide
Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to, I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me, "Is it easy to forget?"
I'll say, "It's easily done
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met"
