<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Went_To_See_The_Gypsy">
I went to see The Gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me comin' an' he said: "well, well, well"
His room was dark and crowded 
lights were low and dim
"How are you"? he said to me 
I said it back to him
I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there and she began to shout
Go on back to see The Gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas 
An' he can do it here
Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched him from the distance with the music in my ears
I went back to see The Gypsy
It was nearly early dawn 
The Gypsy's door was open wide but The Gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl
She could not be found 
So I watched that sun come rising from a little Minnesota town
From that little Minnesota town
