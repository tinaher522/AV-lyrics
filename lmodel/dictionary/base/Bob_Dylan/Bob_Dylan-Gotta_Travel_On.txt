<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Gotta_Travel_On">
Done laid around, done stayed around, this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
Papa writes to Johnny, Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny, Johnny can't come home
Johnny's been out on the road too long
Done laid around, done stayed around, this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Going home to stay, Going home to stay
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I feel like I just wanna travel on
Done laid around, done stayed around, this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
There's a lonesome freight at six'o eight, a comin' through the town
I'll be homeward bound,  I'll be homeward bound
A lonesome freight at six'o eight comin' on through the town
And I'll feel like I just a want to travel on
Done laid around, done stayed around, this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
And it seems like I gotta travel on.
