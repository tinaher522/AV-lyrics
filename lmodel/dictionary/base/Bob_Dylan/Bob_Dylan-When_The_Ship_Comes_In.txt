<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="When_The_Ship_Comes_In">
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And the morning will be a-breaking
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And be buried at the bottom of the ocean
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in
And they'll raise their hands, saying "We'll meet all your demands"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered"
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath they'll be conquered
