<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="One_Too_Many_Mornings">
Down the street the dogs are barkin' and the day is gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-fallin' the dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
For I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind
From the crossroads of my doorstep, my eyes, they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind
It's a restless hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
When everything I'm a-sayin', you can say it just as good
You're right from your side, I am right from mine
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind
