<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="I'm_A_Fool_To_Want_You">
I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss that the devil has known
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I had to say
I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along, without you
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I have to say
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along, without you
