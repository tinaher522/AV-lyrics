<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Little_Drummer_Boy">
Come they told me 
A new born king to see 
Our finest gifts we bring 
To lay before the king 
So to honor him 
When we come
Little Baby 
I am a poor boy too 
I have no gift to bring 
That's fit to give the king 
Shall I play for you
On my drum? 
Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for him
I played my best for him
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum
