<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Watered_Down_Love">
Love that's pure hopes all things
Believes all things, won't pull no strings
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom
You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame
Will not deceive you or lead you to transgression
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession
You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love
Love that's pure won't lead you astray
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious
You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love
Love that's pure, no accident
It knows what it knows, is always content
An eternal flame, quietly burning
Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning
You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love
