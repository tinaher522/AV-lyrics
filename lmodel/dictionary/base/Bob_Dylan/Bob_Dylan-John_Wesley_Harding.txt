<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="John_Wesley_Harding">
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor
He traveled with a gun in every hand
All along this countryside he opened many a door
But he was never known to hurt an honest man
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about
With his lady by his side he took a stand
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
For he was always known to lend a helping hand
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound
But no charge held against him could they prove
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down
He was never known to make a foolish move
