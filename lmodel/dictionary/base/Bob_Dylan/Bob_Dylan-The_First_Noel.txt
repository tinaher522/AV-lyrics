<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="The_First_Noel">
The first noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Kissed by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent 
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
A noel
