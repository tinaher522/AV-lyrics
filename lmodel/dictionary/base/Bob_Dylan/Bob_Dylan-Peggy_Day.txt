<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Peggy_Day">
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright
Man, that girl is out of sight
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night
Well, you know ever even before I learned her name
You know I loved her just the same
And I tell 'em all, wherever I may go, just so they'll know
That she's my little lady and I love her so
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
Turned my skies to blue from gray
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day
