<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Tonight_I'll_Be_Staying_Here_With_You">
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
For your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you
Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive?
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave
I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster too
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
