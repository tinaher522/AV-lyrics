<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="When_Did_You_Leave_Heaven">
When did you leave heaven ?
How could they let you go ?
How's every thing in heaven ?
I'd like to know.
Why did you trade heaven ?
For all these earthly things ?
Where on earth you hide halo ?
Where did you lose your wings ?
Have they missed you ?
Can you get back in ?
If I kiss you would it be a sin ?
I am only human but you are so divine.
When did you leave heaven angel mine ?
