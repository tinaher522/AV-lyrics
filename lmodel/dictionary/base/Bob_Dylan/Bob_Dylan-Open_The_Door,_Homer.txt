<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Open_The_Door,_Homer">
Now there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
That he'd make sure I'd always understand
And that there is one certain way that a man must swim
Where he expects to live off the fat of the land.
Open the door, Richard
I heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I heard it said before
But I ain't gonna here it said no more.
Now there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend Mouse
A fellow who always blushes
An' that is that everyone must always flush out their house
If they don't expect to be goin' 'round housin' flushes.
Open the door, Richard
I heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I heard it said before
But I ain't gonna here it said no more.
Now, take care of all of your memories, said my friend Nick
And remember now you cannot relive them
And do not forget that when you go out to heal the sick
That you must always first forgive them.
Open the door, Richard
I heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I heard it said before
But I ain't gonna here it said no more.
