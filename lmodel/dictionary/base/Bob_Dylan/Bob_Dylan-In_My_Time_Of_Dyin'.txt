<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="In_My_Time_Of_Dyin'">
Well, in my time of dyin'
Don't want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do is
Take my body home, well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well well
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
If these wings should fail me, Lord
Won't you meet me with another pair
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well well
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Lord, in my time of dying
Don't want nobody to cry
All I want you to do is
Take me when I die
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well well
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
