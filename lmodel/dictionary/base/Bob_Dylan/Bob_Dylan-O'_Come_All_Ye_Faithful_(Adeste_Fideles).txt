<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="O'_Come_All_Ye_Faithful_(Adeste_Fideles)">
O Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord
O sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word
Give to our father glory in the highest
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord
All Hail! Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
O Jesus! for evermore
Be thy name adored
Word of the father, now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord
