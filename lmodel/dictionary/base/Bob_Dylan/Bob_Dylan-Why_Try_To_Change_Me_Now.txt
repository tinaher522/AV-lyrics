<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="Why_Try_To_Change_Me_Now">
I'm sentimental
So I walk in the rain
I've got some habits
Even I can't explain
Could start for the corner
Turn up in Spain
Why try to change me now?
I sit and daydream
I've got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes
There they go on the floor
I go away weekends
And leave my keys in the door
But why try to change me now?
Why can't I be more conventional
People talk, people stare, so I try
But that's not for me, cause I can't see
My kind of crazy world go passing me by
So let people wonder
Let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
You know I'll love you 
Till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember
I was always your clown
Why try to change me now?
Don't you remember
I was always your clown
But why try to change me?
Why try to change me now?
