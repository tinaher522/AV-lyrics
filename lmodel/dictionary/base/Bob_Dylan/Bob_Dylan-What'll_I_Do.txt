<song artist="Bob_Dylan" title="What'll_I_Do">
What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?
What'll I do
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?
What'll I do
With just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?
What'll I do
With just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?
