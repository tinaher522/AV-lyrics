<song artist="Seal" title="The_Right_Life">
Caught up in my life
Waiting to be set free
Waiting to find my answer
Come if it feels right
Now is the time to be
No need to find forgiveness
Cause every month some child wants to make love
Fantasize about some vision
Funny how the lost guy
makes the deal (the deal 6x)
Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
Oooh, living it
Living in the streets
Try to find a better way
Elevator take me higher
There's a place for me
All I want the news today
Elevator take me higher, take me higher, take me higher, take me higher
Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
Oooh, living it
Oooh, living it
Just when you thought you were lonely
They came along with the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Living the right life
Cause in a month
some child wants to make love
Fantasize about some vision
Funny how the lost guy
makes the deal (the deal, the deal, the deal, the deal, the deal, the deal)
Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
