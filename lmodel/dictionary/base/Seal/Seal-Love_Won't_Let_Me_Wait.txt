<song artist="Seal" title="Love_Won't_Let_Me_Wait">
The time is right
You hold me tight
And love is got me high
Please tell me, yes
And don't say no, honey not tonight
I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
'Till I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
'Cause love won't let me wait
(Not one more minute, baby)
The time is right
Turned down the lights and take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night in a wonderland
Now move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait
(No, listen girl)
I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We will explode in ecstacy
And I won't take the blame
'Cause love won't let me wait, no
Love won't let me wait (my temperature's rising)
Love won't let me wait (cause your so tantalizing)
(Oh, listen girl)
Love won't let me wait
