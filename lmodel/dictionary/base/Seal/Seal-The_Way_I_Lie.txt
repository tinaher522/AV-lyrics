<song artist="Seal" title="The_Way_I_Lie">
I, I remember when, when we first met
Not in subterranean
You were young, free of confusion
And I could see you lived just for the moment
I didn't hesitate, I took you by waist
And took what you were giving
And you said, "Oh, is that how you do it
Then let's get to it, with you I feel free"
Darling, you, you keep holdin' on
Tryin' to be strong but it won't be long
Before you, you ask me to say
That we'll be okay so I play along
But you don't notice the way I lie
Way I lie, oh, yeah
Yes, we had love but we had bad timing
And there's nothing you can do, no
When all that you're livin' for
Comes tumblin' to the floor and now you are free
Darling, you, you keep holdin' on
Tryin' to be strong but it won't be long
Before you, you ask me to say
That we'll be okay so I play along
But you don't notice
Outside a city sleeps, inside you weep
We took it all too far
But it's because of truth I believe it too
We have to know who we are
Darling, you, you ask me to say
That we'll be okay so I play along
But you still don't notice the way I lie
Way I lie
I say you, you don't notice the way I lie
I say you, you don't notice the way I lie
I say you, you don't notice the way I lie
I say you, you don't notice the way I lie
I say you, you don't notice the way I lie, lie
I say you, you don't notice the way I lie
