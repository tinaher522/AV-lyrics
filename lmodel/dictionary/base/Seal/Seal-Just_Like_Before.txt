<song artist="Seal" title="Just_Like_Before">
Just like before
Rain came down like a melody at your door
Heard it before
Rain in your hair
Cried last night but you couldn't get out of bed
What was the use of crying
Baby baby can I come inside
Baby baby what's takin' so long
Baby baby god I know it's right
Baby baby can we go on
Just like before
A train came by but it didn't stop at your door
I'd left like a fool
Pray that your byes be bygones
For crying out loud when the feeling inside is bad
What was the use of crying
Baby baby can I come inside
Baby baby what's takin' so long ('cause my heart is achin')
Baby baby god I know it's right
Baby baby can we go on
In this dream
Not could recall and it's you (?)
And I like the way this feels
Family at the top and the bottom is you
And I like the way this feels, feels, feels
Baby baby can I come inside
Baby baby what's takin' so long ('cause my heart is achin')
Baby baby god I know it's right
Baby baby god I know it's right
What was the use of crying?
God I know it's right
God I know it's right
