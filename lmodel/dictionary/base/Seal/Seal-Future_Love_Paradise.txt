<song artist="Seal" title="Future_Love_Paradise">
But if only you could see them
You would know from their faces
There were kings and queens
Followed by princes and princesses
There were future power people
Throwin love to the loveless
Shining a light 'cause they wanted it seen
Well, there were cries
Well, there were cries of why
Followed by cries of why
Followed by cries of why not
Can I reach out for you if that feels good to me?
CHORUS
And the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise
No, the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise (paradise, yeah)
Mm, don't you know that racism in among future kings
Can only lead to no good? (to no good)
Besides your, sons and daughters (sons and daughters)
Already know how that feels, one day
One day (One day)
All the queens will gather round
Spreading love and unity so we can be found
Well then all the writers say it's all to do with drugs
Drugs for the gentlemen
When your love
Inject me with a love, all right
Oh
And the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise
No, the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise (paradise, yeah)
And the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise
No, the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise (paradise, yeah)
Paradise, yeah
(Love paradise) one in and out is gonna make you feel good
(Paradise) coming at you like a hurricane would
(Paradise) stay close to me I'll always be by your side
Save it, baby, you know that it's all right
(Paradise) you remind me of a girl I knew paradise
(Paradise) born so beautiful once aside her
(Paradise) you make me feel like I need your love, love, love
Want to fill me with your love
Fix me with your love, all right
And the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise
No, the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise (paradise, yeah)
And the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise
No, the riders will not stop us
'Cause the only love they'll find is paradise (paradise, yeah)
Oh, we'll be livin' in a paradise
Damn well then make you feel surely
Like you've felt never felt before I'll
Give myself to you
And if you change your mind
I'll do anything
Just to make the world peaceful
Just to make life wonderful
I will drown all your sorrows
In a future love paradise
Future love paradise
Future love paradise
Damn, well, then make you feel surely
Like you've never felt before
I'll give myself
