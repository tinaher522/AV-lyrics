<song artist="Seal" title="Blues_In_"E"_(Non-Album_Track)">
The dark eyed, brown haired lover
From hard time Israel
Is looking for a soul to take over
She's looking for some love to sell
The speed that we go is faster
Than everything in soul and mind
She's trained to touch your body, baby
She's trained to blow your fuckin' mind
But you seem to hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on to your love
Making love is just a fairy tale
And all she ever wanted was to be herself, oh yeah
Oh yeah
What, what, what is good for me is good for her
Is good for us in time
Tame the transcendental meditation
Oh, why
Something in my mind is trying to tell me
"No it's not the way it's supposed to be
If you want her, you're doomed"
But you say
Hold on, hold on
Hold on to your love, baby, baby
'Cause making love is just a fairy tale
And all she ever wanted was to be herself
We got them babies makin' babies
And it's not too good a time
For your love, baby
For your love
The dark eyed, brown haired lover
From hard time Israel
Looking for a soul to take over
Looking for some love to sell
The speed that we go is faster
Than everything in soul and mind
Trained to touch your body, baby
Trained to blow your fuckin' mind
But you say, hold on, hold on, hold on
I say hold on, I say hold on, hold on, baby, to your love, baby
Making love is just a fairy tale
And I say that all you ever wanted was to be yourself, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
She's your lover, babe
She's your love
She's your lover, babe
