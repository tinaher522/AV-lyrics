<song artist="Seal" title="Lonelinest_Star">
Picture the sky that is how high I reach
So far alive none have been right for me
But your love, is a chance I'd like to take
With each breath in me I wait
If it brings you back to me
Because I'm free and I'm young
I'm the loneliest star from the sun
But I feel that I'm close to the one
Who will stop me from coming undone
'Cause I'm free
I have been close
I have been almost near (who do you really want to make it, who do you want to kill)
But city light
But nothing quite like here (who do you really want to be right here)
And your love, (your love) is a light that binds us both, (your love)
With each breath in me I hope
We won't throw it all away
Don't you know that I'm free and I'm young
I'm the loneliest star from the sun
And I feel that I'm close to the one
Who will stop me from coming undone
(With your love)
I know that I could be the best with,
(With your love)
I know that I can take a risk with
(With your love)
I could fly with your love
(With your love, with your love)
If anyone would try and mess with
(With your love)
you and I would be possessed with
(With your love)
I would die for you love
(With your love)
Don't you know that I'm free and I'm young
I'm the loneliest star from the sun
But I feel that I'm close to the one
Who will stop me from coming undone
'Cause I'm free, don't you know I'm free
'Cause I'm free, don't you know I'm free.
