<song artist="Seal" title="I_Know_What_You_Did">
You make me feel so dumb
Like always, there isn't anyone else
But I know what you did, I know what you came for
Driving me insane you wait by my door
I didn't know what to say
Like always I said it anyway
Said it anyway
It only seems like it was yesterday
So it ain't all the way, all the way, yeah
You leave me now with even less to say
So it ain't all the way
You always loved the sea
You never give me any reason to break away
But I know what you did, yes, I know what you came for
Driving me insane you wait by my door
I didn't know what to say, yeah
Like always I, I said it anyway
I said it anyway
It only seems like it was yesterday
So it ain't all the way, all the way, yeah
You leave me now with even less to say
So it ain't all the way
The love from me you drained
I love you so if just to ease my pain
I know what you did, I know what you came for
Driving me insane you wait by my door
