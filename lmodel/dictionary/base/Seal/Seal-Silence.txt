<song artist="Seal" title="Silence">
Silence is cruel and bright 
When you've been up all night 
Another lonely scene 
Watching' it pass us by 
Silence can't be any louder 
When you're gone 
How can it be any louder 
When you're gone? 
I have this need for love 
When dreamin' is not enough 
Baby, it's 3 in the morning 
And sleepin' is not easy 
Silence can't be any louder 
When you're gone 
How can it be any louder 
When you're gone? 
What do we do, what do we say? 
How was your morning 
And did you have a nice day? 
What do we do, what do we say? 
If you need me 
Don't you worry, love, I'll come home 
(Will you call if you need me?) 
If you need me 
Don't you worry, love, I'm comin' home 
(It can't be any louder) 
If you need me 
(Silence can't be any louder) 
Don't you worry, love, I'm comin' home 
(When you're gone) 
If you need me 
(How can it be much louder) 
Don't you worry, love, I'm comin' home 
(When you're gone?) 
If you need me 
(If you need me) 
Don't you worry, love, I'll come home 
(I will be standing there) 
(Yes, I will be there) 
If you need me 
(I will be there with my heart still beating) 
Don't you worry, love, I'm comin' home
