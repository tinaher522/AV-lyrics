(Billy Roberts)
Hey Joe,
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand. 
Hey Joe,
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand. 
I'm goin down to shot my ol' lady,
I caught her messin' 'round with another man.
Oh
Hey Joe,
I heard you shot your lady down, 
Hey Joe,
Joe, I heard you shot your lady down,
Shot her down town. 
Yes I did, I shot her.
'Cause I caught my woman foolin 'round
So I shot her down town. 
She gave me the gun,
And I shot her. 
Hoooooo hoo hoo. 
Well Hey Joe,
Where you gonna run to now? 
Well Hey Joe,
Joe, where you gonna run to now?
Where ya gonna run to? 
I'm goin' way down south.
Way down Mexico way. 
I said-a,
I'm way down south, baby,
Way down where I can be free.
Ain't no-one gonna find me.
Go,
Ain't no hangman gonna,
Ain't no hangman that's gonna put a noose around me.
No no ain't no-one gonna find me,
No-one gonna find me. 
Hey Joe,
Said there ain't no hangman gonna,
No, no.
No, no.
No, no-ho. 
Hey Joe,
No, no, don't go.
Don't go.
