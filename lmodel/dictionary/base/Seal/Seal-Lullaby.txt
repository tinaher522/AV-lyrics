<song artist="Seal" title="Lullaby">
You still love me 
So I do care 
Baby let shake it 
Let's love it 
Fight it 
Because 
Baby let's do it 
Let take it 
Don't waste it 
I'll love you until we die 
Were just a human creatures 
But you is one of a kind 
Because you only got me and 
Because you only kind of person that 
Hook me because you is the 
HOOKER of my lonely heart 
HOOK-ER-ER-ER HOOK-ER-ER-ER 
Unforgettable 
HOOK-ER-ER-ER HOOK-ER of my lonely heart 
Oooooooh-Oooh 
Oooooooh-Oooh
