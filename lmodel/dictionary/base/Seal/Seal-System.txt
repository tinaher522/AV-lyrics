<song artist="Seal" title="System">
Some day, evermore
Some day, evermore
Some day, evermore
Some day, evermore
Son you better go for it
Harmony, dissatisfaction
And a pocket full of lies
'Cause I guess that's what they want
Son your father's known for it
Misery, can you read my lips
'Cause this is my way of breaking ties
Is it true that's what you want
I know this colour coating can't be right
When the only truth is we don't sleep at night
Can it feel real
We're just trying to beat the system
But it's hard from a distance
We keep falling from the system
So it's time for a new better way
We're just trying to beat the system
And it's time for a new better way
Lie now your people need to get
High, everybody needs a little
Sunshine from a burnt red sky
'Cause that's just what they want
We know this colour coating can't be right
When the only truth is we don't sleep at night
Can it feel real
We're just trying to beat the system
But it's hard from a distance
We keep falling from the system
So it's time for a new better way
We're just trying to beat the system
But it's hard from a distance
We keep falling from the system
So it's time for a new better way
We're just trying to beat the system
But it's hard from a distance
We keep falling from the system
So it's time for a new better way
Better way
Better way
Better way
Some day, evermore
Some day, evermore
Some day, evermore
