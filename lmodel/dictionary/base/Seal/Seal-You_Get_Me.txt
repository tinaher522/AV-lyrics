<song artist="Seal" title="You_Get_Me">
If I say no, if I resist
If I don't give in to this
Would it be
A lesson or a loss?
Suddenly I know what it's about
Thoughts come in and words come out
Suddenly I'm not killing time
It's all over now
You get me, you get me
Like a beautiful song
You've heard a million times
Like that rainbow's end
You can never find
You get me, you get me
If I say yes, if I let it go
And face the consequence I've known
Would it lead to
Living with regret?
Suddenly the walls are comin' down
I won't be the same when I come around
Suddenly I am understood
But it's all over now
You get me, you get me
Just like a red sunset
Where the sky meets the sea
Like no one alive
You appear in my dreams
You get me, you get me
Honey, you get me, you get me
Like a beautiful song
You've heard a million times
Like that rainbow's end
That you can never find
It's hard to ignore
Undeniable too
This feeling inside
When I look at you
You get me, you get me
