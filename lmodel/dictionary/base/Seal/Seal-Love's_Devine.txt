<song artist="Seal" title="Love's_Devine">
There the rain storm came over me
And I felt my spirit break
I had lost
All of my
Belief you see
And realised my mistake
But time
Threw a prayer to me
And all around me became still
I need love
Love's devine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love
Love is what I need to help me know my name
Through the rain storm came sanctury
And I felt my spirit fly
I have found
All of my
Reality
And realised what it takes
'Cause I need love
Love's devine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love
Love is what I need to help me know my name
Oh
I don't bed
Don't pray
Show me how to live it
Promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know my name
Well I tried to say there's nothing wrong
But inside I felt me lying all along
What the message here was plain to see
Believe me
'Cause I need love
Love's devine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love
Love is what I need to help me know my name
Oh
I don't bed
Don't pray
Show me how to live it
Promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know my name
Love can help me know my name
