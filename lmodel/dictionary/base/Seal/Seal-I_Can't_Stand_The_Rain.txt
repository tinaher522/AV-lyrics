<song artist="Seal" title="I_Can't_Stand_The_Rain">
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
You're bringing back
Sweet memories
Hey, window pain
Do you remember
How sweet it
Used to be
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now, now that we've parted
You know there's one thing
That i just can't stand
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
Bringing back
Sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
'Cause he's not
Here for me
'Lone with the pillow
Where's his head
Used to lay
Well, i know
You've got
Some sweet memories
But like a window
You ain't got nothin'
To say
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window, yeah
You're bringing back
Sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Know, know
Know of the rain
Know of the rain
Oh, no yeah
Oh, no, no, no
Don't be okay, rain
