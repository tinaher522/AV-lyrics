<song artist="Seal" title="Deep_Water">
I'll kiss that away
Both of them swam from a northern blue sky
Smile on their faces they entered their doom like they knew
If their world should end they won't care about that anyway
I jade the water and I burn the fire (oh, I burn the fire)
Nuclear chemicals making their doom like you knew
If the world should end you won't care about that anyway
Maybe that's the way you live your life, but I know
Life it don't always live that way
Jade, a shade of pain and then we die
Jade, a shade of pain and then we die
Jade, a shade of pain and then we die
(But it's just the way)
Maybe that's the way you live you life but I know
Life, you see, it don't always live that way
Jade, a shade of pain and then we die
Jade, a shade of pain and then we die (oh, why)
Jade (a shade of pain and then we die)
Maybe that's the way
Maybe that's the way, but it don't always live that way
Now, that I understand the beauty of what they've left to hand me down
When you need a place to live, and no one understands you
And all you want to do is to cry out loud
But you don't know how
No way, no one, no one understands
The hand that strikes when just a touch of love is all the problem needed
And when you hurt someone so much that still they die loving you
And all you want to do is to cry out loud
But you don't know how
Jade
Jade, a shade of pain and then the memory dies
Jade a shade of pain and then, and then we die
Jade (oh, no, no) a shade of pain and then, and then we die
(Jade) but you don't know how
(Jade) until you try some how
(Jade) like you don't know how
(Jade) but you don't know how
(And then we die)
We will find a way
Letting the sun go down
Maybe we'll find a way
Holding the sun
We will find a way
Letting our life go by
I tell you we'll find away
Holding the Sun
The Sun
