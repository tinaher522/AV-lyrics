<song artist="Seal" title="Wild">
With you on a clear day, yeah
If tried I don't think I could end it better this way
All I have is a photograph
And if loneliness can hurt as much as being cold
Come over here, woman, and touch me, you look so electric
'Cause all I ask is a second chance
Stroll on, lady
Stroll on
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve, and you take over
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve, and you take over my pain
Oh, lord
You got a tear in your eye and a look to match it
Well, maybe you think you just can't get me out of your hair
Don't try to resist it, 'cause
We're getting stronger, the closer we become
You are the best thing in my life
Stroll on, lady
Stroll on, and take it to the edge (oh, yeah)
Stroll on, lady
Stroll on
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make the world resolve and you take over
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make the world resolve and you take over
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve and you take over for
How long?
How long? oh, with my pain
How long?
Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na
Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na
Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na
Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na
Oh, and I don't need no one downstairs darlin
(Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na)
(Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na)
(Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na)
(Na-na na na na na na na na-na na na na)
Wild aces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve, and you take over
Wild aces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve, and you take over
Wild aces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve, and you take over
All my pain, oh, babe
All of my pain, love, love
Yeah, yeah
All my pain
As you strip off my clothes
Acknowledge my pride
You took away all I got
I got
You took away all I got
Take all I got
All I got, baby
All I got
All I got
I got, baby
Took what I got
What I got, baby
Took all I got
