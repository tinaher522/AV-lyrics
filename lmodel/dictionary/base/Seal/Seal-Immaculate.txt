<song artist="Seal" title="Immaculate">
This hallowed faith
Of what might be
Feather white skin
And ebony
If all the world
Could see us now
They'd realize
That we could be immaculate
If all the world could see us now
I watch you bathe
Washing my sin
One can't describe
This love I'm in
Well I testify (Well I testify)
Before you now (Well I testify)
No wasting time (Well I testify?)
No wait in vain
If all the world (Well I testify)
Could see us now (Well I testify)
They'd realize (Well I testify)
That we could be immaculate
If all the world could see us now
(See us now)
(See us now)
I don't want to lose control but when it comes to race
I don't want to be the one to never seize the day
I want you to come with me and we can break away
From the unnatural
If all the world (Well I testify)
Could see us now (Well I testify)
They'd realize (Well I testify)
That we could be immaculate
If all the world could see us now
If all the world could see us now
If all the world could see us now
(See us now)
(See us now)
We're living for the world
(See us now)
(See us now)
Living in a dream
(See us now)
(See us now)
If all the world could see us now
(See us now)
(See us now)
