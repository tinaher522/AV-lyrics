<song artist="Seal" title="Whirlpool">
She don't know, woohoo
Your momma would
Yeah, yeah
Oh, no, no
Woman-child, no
Woman-child
I wake out of a whirlpool
I walk into another day and then
I feel better
Whoah, whoah
Because you came to stay
I almost threw my life away
Thinking of what might be
If I lose my destiny
Would I feel better than I might be?
Would I see clearer than my eyes would see?
Oh, I, if I showed I love you angel?
Like a square in a circle
I try to find another way to win
I try to make a better way
To the castle that I make
Where the Moon lights the way
And it's invisible by day
I hear temptation sing, yeah
Just let go, and I will take you there
Now, would I feel better than I might be?
Would I see more clearly than my eyes would see, yeah?
Oh I, If I showed I love you angel, yeah?
If I fell in love with angel?
If I showed I love you angel?
Oh, ah
Now would I feel better than I might be?
Would I see more clearly than my eyes would see, yeah?
Oh, I, If I showed I love you angel?
If I took a piece of angel?
If I fell in love with angel, oh?
Life is hard in a circle
Especially when you think you've gone insane
And all you get from love is lots of pain
I should have known better
(Ah) better
(Ah) better
(Ah) better
(Ah) better
(Ah)
(Ah) better
(Ah)
