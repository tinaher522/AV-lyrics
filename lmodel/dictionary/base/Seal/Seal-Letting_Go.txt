<song artist="Seal" title="Letting_Go">
Baby, baby, why must you travel?
Four little faces, they need you home
Laughing, crying, a boy in your shadow
Just by the suitcases, now he knows
Watching the suitcases, now he knows
Always a feelin' inside every time that you go
Letting go
So many places you hide but you never belong
Letting go
Dying to see you tonight, I'm alive when you're home
When you're home
You're my only way to the water
Throw me inside, let me drink off you
And maybe, maybe, I'll give you a daughter
Maybe we'll see what this love can do
Then we will see what this love can do
Always feelin' inside every time that you go
Letting go
So many places you fly to but never belong
Letting go
Dying to see you tonight, I'm alive when you're home
When you're home
Letting go
Always a feelin' inside every time that you go
Letting go
So many places you fly to but never belong
Letting go
Dying to see you tonight, I'm alive when you're home
When you're home
When you're home
When you're home
When you're home
Baby, baby, why must you travel?
Four little faces, they need you home
