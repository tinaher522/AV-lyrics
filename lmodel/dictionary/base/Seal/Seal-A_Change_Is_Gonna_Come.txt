<song artist="Seal" title="A_Change_Is_Gonna_Come">
I was born by the river, in a little tent
And oh, just like that river, I've been running ever since
It's been a long, long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there, beyond the sky
It's been a long, long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Now I go to the movies, and I go downtown
But somebody keeps telling me don't hang around
It's been a long, long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Yes, sir
So now I go to my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me, please"
But somehow, he winds up knocking me
Back down on my knees
Oh, there were times I thought I wouldn't last for long
Now I think I'm able, able to carry on
It's been a long, long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, yes it will, oh,  I know
A change is gonna come
I said I know
A change is gonna come, hey, yeah
A change is gonna come, right now
A change is gonna come, I see it now, yeah, oh my, yeah
I said a change is gonna come
