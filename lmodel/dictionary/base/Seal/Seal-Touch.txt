<song artist="Seal" title="Touch">
Without your touch I've been lost without the things I love
Without your kiss I've been dreaming of the things I miss
Your eyes, your mouth, your lips, your touch
Your eyes, your mouth, your face, your touch
Who am I (Who am I)
I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell)
Of what would be (of what would be)
No one knows (Still)
Who am I (I need to know)
I'm not to tell (What time excel)
What would be well (will really show)
Let it be
Each day we miss
I remember times I used to kiss
Your mouth, your eyes, your face, your touch
But who am I (Who am I)
I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell)
Of what would be (of what would be)
No one knows (Still)
Who am I (I need to know)
I'm not to tell (What time excel)
What would be well (will really show)
Let it be
(Still, I need to know
What time excel will really show
Still, I need to know
What time excel will really show)
And I say
Who am I (Who am I)
I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell)
Of what would be well (of what would be)
No one knows (Still)
Who am I (I need to know)
I'm not to tell (What time excel)
What would be well (will really show)
Let it be
Who am I (Who am I)
I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell)
Of what would be well (of what would be)
No one knows (Still)
Who am I (I need to know)
I'm not to tell (What time excel)
What would be well (will really show)
Let it be
Your mouth, your eyes, your face, your touch
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
