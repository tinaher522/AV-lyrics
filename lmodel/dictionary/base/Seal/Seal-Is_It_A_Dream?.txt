(Seal) 
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
(repeat 20 times)
There was hope
And faith
In quality
And grace
We were close
At heart
And still
I am here 
And sure
From everything
And pure
I am here
And now
And real
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Or my fantasies
Is it just a dream?
I feel like I could be a star
And I feel like I could be someone
I feel like I could be a star
And I feel like I could be someone
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Or my fantasies
Is this just a dream?
There was hope
And faith
In quality
And grace
We were close
At heart
And still
I am here 
And sure
From everything
And pure
And I feel like I could be someone
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
I feel like I could be a star
And I feel like I could be someone
Is it just a dream?
Reoccuring dream
Is it just a dream?
Or my fantasies
