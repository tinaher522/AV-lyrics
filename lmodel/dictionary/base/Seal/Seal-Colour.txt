<song artist="Seal" title="Colour">
Oh
Colour fades away
With a light descending on the day
Midnight sees your friend
Oh, could you call his name?
Would you know his name?
I come here for your love
But, God only knows
(Ah) colour fades away (ah)
(Ah) good times here today (ah)
(Ah) meanwhile you would say
I close my eyes
Colour fades away
Tell who are you for anyway?
Midnight is your friend
Will we see a beginning in the end?
God only knows what we've put in that paint
God only knows...
(Ah) colour fades away (ah)
(Ah) good times here today, (ah) here most every day
(Ah) meanwhile you would say (ah)
(Ah) I close my eyes
And dream of only yesterday
(Ah) colour fades away (ah)
(Ah) good times here today, (ah) here most every day
(Ah) meanwhile you would say (ah)
That I close my eyes
Colour
Fades to grey
I dream so exciting
But, I, I feel so bold
(Midnight)
(Midnight)
(Midnight)
(Midnight)
(Midnight)
(Midnight)
