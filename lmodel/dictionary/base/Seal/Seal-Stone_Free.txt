<song artist="Seal" title="Stone_Free">
Baby babe, I'm all weak from talking
And if I stay too long
People try to slow me down
They talk about me like a dog
They talk about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize
They're the ones who're square
So that's why
They can't slow me down
I don't want to be slowed down
I gotta move on
Stone free
To do as I please
Stone free
To ride with the breeze
Stone free
To do as I say
I gotta gotta gotta get away
C'mon
Woman here, woman there
Try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize
It's so easy to break
Oh but sometimes I get hot
Just trying to get out of here
Oh, but they don't realize
They're the ones who're square
So that's why
They can't slow me down
I don't want to be slowed down
I gotta move on
Ohh!
Stone free
To do as I please
Stone free
To ride with the breeze
Stone free
To do as I say
I gotta gotta gotta get away
From here...
Hold back
Round and round and round we go
Hold me my darlin'
Don't be late
Oh for the show
Stone free
To do as I please
Stone free
To ride with the breeze
Stone free
To do as I say
I gotta gotta gotta get away
Stone free
To do as I please
Stone free
Just to ride with that breeze
Stone free
To do as I say
I gotta gotta gotta get away
