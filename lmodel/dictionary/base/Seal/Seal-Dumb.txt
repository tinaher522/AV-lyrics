<song artist="Seal" title="Dumb">
Silence in your voice
Screaming I've no
Choice cause I'm angry
Angry and lonely
Silence while you steal
Feeding from the
Will of my babies
My one and only's
So, wish that I could make you see
The harm in what you did
But I never hear you scream
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Silence while you win
Gleaming like a
Toe dying ugly
Rocks in you belly
There's silence every day
Cause I know that there's no
Way I can save you
Cause you won your own blue
But true remain
So, wish that I could make you see
The harm in what you did
But I never hear you scream
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb X8
Whoa, the lonely, I sing this for you only
Whoa, the lonely, a freind that I once knew
Whoa, the lonely, if you and me if only
For a friend I once knew
A friend I once knew
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
Dumb-da-dumb-dumb-dumb
