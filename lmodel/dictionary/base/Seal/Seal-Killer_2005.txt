Brother... Brother... (L)
Sister... Sister... (L)
It's the loneliness that's the killer
So you want,
To be free.
To live your life,
The way you want to be.
Will you give,
If we cry?
Will we live,
Or will we.. die?
Ohh...
Hearts...
Jaded hearts
Heal with time
... Oh whoah whoah whoah...
Shoot that love
So we can
Stop the bleeding
Ohh...
Solitary brother...

Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister...

Is there still a part of you that wants to give?
Solitary brother...

Is there still a part of you that wants to live?

If we try
And live our lives
The way we want to...be.. Yeah..
Oh... love love
Oh... love love
Oh... love love
Brother... brother...

Brother... brother... brother... brother...brother...
There's no other love... There's no other love... There's no other love...
There is no other love no other love like ours...
There's no other love... There's no other love... There's no other love...
There is no other love no other love like ours...
There's no other love... There's no other love... There's no other love...
There's no other love... There's no other love... There's no other love...
There is no love

Racism in among future kings can only lead to no good.
Besides, all our sons and daughters already know how that feels.
Yeah yeah yeah...
Love love love...
