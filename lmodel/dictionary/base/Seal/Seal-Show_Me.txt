La
La
La la la-la la-la
Different kinds of people
Different kinds of life
We go walking towards the future
With different size strides
Show me the way to solve your sorrows
And I'll do what I can
'Cause we have the experience
If we plan
Baby, we can see that close
Show me the way to solve your problems and I'll be there
Show me the way, and I'll do what I can
What can I say, oh, lately, what can I do?
I just can't stand losing
Welcome to the new world
Let me join your hand
We go walking through the old world
With a brand new plan all over
God only knows how much I love you
Give me a chance, and I'll show the faith all over
You will understand, lady
If you change your mind
Baby, only I know what you need
Show me the way to solve your problems and I'll be there
Show me the way and I'll do all I can
What can I say, oh lady, what can I do? (no, I can't stand)
I just can't stand losing you
Don't mean to take up your time, baby
I won't be stomping on your life
I only wanted to make you see
Oh, that you
Only you know what I need
Then maybe I can take you higher
Then maybe I can stop those tears
I can stop those tears
Oh, with you
Sha da da-da da
Show me the way to solve your problems and I'll be there
Show me the way and I'll do what I can
What can I say, oh, lady, what can I do?
I just can't stand losing
Show me the way to solve your problems and I'll be there
Show me the way and I'll do what I can
What can I say, oh, lately, what can I do? (no, I can't stand)
I just can't stand losing you
Losing you
Show me the way to solve your problems, and I'll be there
Show me the way to solve your problems, and I'll call you
Just show me the way to solve your problems, and I'll be there
Show me the way to solve
I'll call you
