<song artist="Seal" title="Best_Of_Me">
You wore a gown that evening
That brought me to my knees
Never before could so much beauty
Have affected me
And I thought I needed no one
I had it all complete
Who would have thought that we could be?
But I guess not me
But you got the best of me, baby
When we don't try to understand
Our love, our love
You bring out the best in me, baby
When we don't try to understand
Our love, this love
The look in your eyes was lonely
As they're fallin' at your feet
(So many men at your feet)
Which lucky guy will hold your hand?
(I want your lovin' when I touch you, baby)
Well, it can't be me
(Well, it can't be me)
Oh, baby
But I am so tired of running
And I almost didn't see
You standing there without your fame
(I got your lovin' and I got you, baby)
As you reached for me
(I got your lovin' and I got you, baby)
But you got the best of me, baby
When we don't try to understand
Our love, our love
You bring out the best in me, baby
When we don't try to understand
Our love, this love
You bring out the best in me, baby
If you're lookin' for love in this world
People say you will know
When you look the least
If you're dreamin' of love in this world
It will come
I believe, I believe
That you get the best of me, baby
When we don't try to understand
Our love, our love
You bring out the best in me, baby
When we don't try to understand
Our love, this love
But you bring out the best in me, baby
When we are standin' in the aisle
Our love, this love
You bring out the best in me, baby
When we don't try to understand
Our love, this love
I'm so tired of running
I'm so tired of running
