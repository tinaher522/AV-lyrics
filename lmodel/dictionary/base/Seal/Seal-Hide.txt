Okay
You guys 'ow 'bout a bit of rock and roll?
Jodi Luzen came from far away, 
But she knew the song can wrong. 
And she had to keep those blues away,
'Bout as long and all says strong. 
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
First she told me we should check it out,
But I knew that wasn't right.
Then one day I had to do or die,
And I long since have survived.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
Go astray.
All these something I've been trying so hard to find,
All these something yoo-hoo.
All these something I've been trying so hard to get,
Maybe, baby.
That's your line,
That's your line now.
That's your line,
That's your line baby.
We will try so hard to sue,
Then one day that we must carry on.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
Don't you hide your baby,
Don't you hide your love away.
Don't you hide your baby,
Don't you hide your love.
All these something I've been trying so hard to find.
Maybe, maybe.
That's okay,
That's okay, now
That's okay,
That's all right now.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your baby,
Hide, hide, hide, hide.
To the bridge!
Bridge!
All these something I've been trying so hard to get,
All these new.
All these something I've been trying so hard to find,
Baby, baby.
That's okay,
That's okay now.
That's okay,
That's okay now.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
Don't you hide your,
Don't you hide your love away.
Don't you hide your baby,
Don't you hide your.
Thank you very much Dublin,
Very much.
