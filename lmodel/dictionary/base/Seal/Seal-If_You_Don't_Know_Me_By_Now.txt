<song artist="Seal" title="If_You_Don't_Know_Me_By_Now">
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
All the things that weve been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home
Oh don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight
If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never never never know me (no you won't)
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
Weve all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as weve been together it should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye, oh
If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never never never know me (no you won't)
If you don't know me by now (you will never never never know me)
You will never never never know me (ooh)
