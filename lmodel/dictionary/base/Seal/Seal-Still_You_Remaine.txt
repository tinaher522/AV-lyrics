<song artist="Seal" title="Still_You_Remaine">
Without so madly
Without so fast
Yet still we remain
How will I love
If you take all the life
From out of me
Right from out of me
Tell me how will I live
If you take all the give
That you give to me
We burned so brightly
Love so fast
Yet still we remain...
Main...
Ohhhh
'Cause we'll live
And we give
Today...
Ay...
I... ye... ah
But don't ya know
You know
You know
You know
I know
You know
You're nothing I... yeah
Now dontcha know
You know
You know
You know
I know
You know
You're nothing I... yeah...
Now don't ya know
You know
You know
You know
I know
You know
Tell me how will I live
With anyone but you
Babe
Anyone but you babe
With anyone but you
With anyone but you
With anyone but you
