<song artist="Seal" title="Love_Don't_Live_Here_Anymore">
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
When you lived inside of me
There was nothin' I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before you went away
Found another place to stay, another home
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, babe
Love don't live here anymore
In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd you have to go away?
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, babe
Love don't live here anymore
No, no, no
You abandoned me
Love don't live here, live here, no, no
Just a vacancy, babe
Love no more
