<song artist="Seal" title="My_Vision">
I feel like the sun
I feel like the rain
I feel like I just found reason for living again
'Cause what I've been dreaming,
I know that it's real
I know there's just no changing the way I feel
You're into my head
I'm out of my mind
I feel like I've just found reason for being alive
And I have a secret
I think you should know
I feel like I just can't keep it
It's deep within me
And I feel like I'm losing control
Can you see my vision
Of a red hot summer in Ryde?
When love was the feeling
With no indecision
We were turning that key inside
To get in the moment
We live in a dream,
I see you today
I feel like all my fears are fading away
Been waiting so long for something new
I feel like a constant craving for being with you
And I have a secret I think you should know
I feel like I just can't keep it
It's deep within me
And I know that I'm losing control...
Can you see my vision
Of a red hot summer in Ryde?
When love was the feeling
With no indecision
We were turning that key inside
To get in the moment
Can you see my vision
Of a red hot summer in Ryde?
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling
I have a secret,
I think you should know
I feel like I just can't keep it
It's deep within me
And it's deep within me
And it's deep within me
And it's deep within me
And it's deep within me
And it's deep within me
And it's deep within me
And it's deep within me
And I feel like I'm losing control
Can you see my vision
Of a red hot summer in Ryde?
When love was the feeling
With no indecision
We were turning that key inside
To get in the moment
Can you see my vision
Of a red hot summer in Ryde?
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling.
