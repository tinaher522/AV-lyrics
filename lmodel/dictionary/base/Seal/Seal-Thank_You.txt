<song artist="Seal" title="Thank_You">
I wanna thank you for let me be myself again
Looking at the devil
Grinning at the gun
Fingers start shakin
I begin to run
Bullets start chasin
I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle
I was on top
I wanna thank you for let me be myself again
I wanna thank you for let me be myself again
Beat on
Dance to the music
All night long
Everyday people 
Sing a simple song 
Thank you for the party
But I could never stay
Many thangs is on my mind 
Words are in my way
I wanna thank you for let me be myself again
I wanna thank you for let me be myself again
Flamin' eyes of peoples fear
Burnin' into you 
Many men are missin' much
Hatin' what they do 
Youth and truth are makin' love
Dig it for a starter
Dyin' young is hard to take
Sellin' out is so much, so much harder, now
I wanna thank you for let me be myself again
I tried, I tried
I wanna thank you for let me be myself again
I wanna thank, I wanna thank, I wanna thank
(If he says anything else that's actual words I have no idea what they are)
