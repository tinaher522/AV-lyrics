<song artist="Seal" title="Quicksand">
I'm closer to the
Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality
I'm frightened by the total goal
But drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No. I ain't got the power anymore
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
I'm living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
'Cause I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thoughts
And I ain't got the power anymore
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
And I'm livin' on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
Oh, ohhh, if I can't explain what you want to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
'Cause I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thoughts
And I ain't got the power anymore
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
