<song artist="Seal" title="Loneliest_Star">
Picture the sky that is how high I reach
So far alive none have been right for me
But your love, is a chance at life to take
With each breathe in me I wake
If it brings you back to me
Because I'm free and I'm young
I'm the loneliest star from the sun
But I feel that I'm close to the one
Who will stop me from coming undone
Cause I'm free
I have been close
I have been almost real (who do you really want to make it, who do you want to kill)
But city light
But nothing quite like here (who do you really want to be right here)
And your love, (your love) is a life that binds us both, (your love)
With each breathe in me I hold
We won't throw it all away 
Don't you know that I'm free and I'm young
I'm the loneliest star from the sun
And I feel that I'm close to than one
Who will stop me from coming undone
(With your love), I know that I can be the best with, (With your love), I know that I can take a risk with (With your
love), I can fly with your love, (With your love, With your love), if anyone would try to mess with, (With your love), you and I
can be possessed with (With your love), I would die for your love(With your love)
Don't you know that I'm free and I'm young
I'm the loneliest star from the sun
But I feel that I'm close to the one
Who will stop me from coming undone
Cause I'm free, don't you know I'm free
Cause I'm free, don't you know I'm free.
