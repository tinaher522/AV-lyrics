<song artist="Seal" title="Let's_Stay_Together">
I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is alright with me
You make me feel so brand new
And I wanna spend my whole life with you
Let me say that since, since we've been together
Loving forever is what I need, yeah
Oh let me be the one you come running to
'cause I'll never be untrue
Oh let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh ooh yeah yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
And why, somebody tell me
Why do people break up
Oh, then turn around and make up
I just can't see
Oh and you'd never do that to me
Now would you, baby?
Bein' around you is all I see
That's what I wanna do
So let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
