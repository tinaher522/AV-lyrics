(Seal) 
Hey Mr. Shame won't you help me please 'cause I am feelin' poor
This crazy game I play is not the same as the one I played before
When he looked me in the eyes and can he smile, said boy you know the score
Don't you know that love baby don't you know that love is powerful
Whoahh, love power...
Hey Mr. Shame won't you help me please 'cause I am feelin' down
I feel strung out 'cause you know I don't know where the bends are......
When you said I love ya, ohh, I really dig you
But that's okay if that the way you really are
Don't you know that love baby don't you know that love is powerful
Whoah now, love power
Maybe
Whoah now, love power
Maybe
Sing!
Love is powerful
Love is powerful
Love power
Maybe
Ohh...
Love is powerful...
You shoulda known
You shoulda known
You shoulda known...
It's gonna take some time
Now while you change your mind
Depend on how you feel...
It's just a change in time...
You shoulda known
You shoulda known
Maybe you shoulda known...ye-yeah...
That love is powerful...
Shock!
(These lyrics are only heard at the end of the full length vocal mix)
It's not the arrogant... superiority
It's not the pressure
It's the feeling of minority
It's the being taught by those who through our mistakes learned
It's the being hurt by those who took the pill....
These are the questions given out to your life
Take all from life that you can get!
You better believe it!
My love is powerful
Whoah oh...
Love's power
Maybe...
May the sun go rise
Take away the snake this power the sun burns (?)
Make me feel the show (?)
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
