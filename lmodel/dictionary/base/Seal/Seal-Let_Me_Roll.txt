<song artist="Seal" title="Let_Me_Roll">
I'm a needle in a haystack
 I'm a complex soul
 If you get with me baby
 I'm gonna do it all
 Ain't got no famous friends to talk about
 Just heart and soul
 Instead, believe me baby
 And let me roll
 I'm so tired of misdemeanours
 I get onto cruise control
 All I want is a chance to be here
 I'm prepared to lose my soul
 Ain't got no Escalade to talk about
 Just heart and soul
 Instead, believe me baby
 And let me roll
 Let me roll
 'Cause I'm not too proud to beg
 Please let me roll
 'Cause I'll be kickin' inside your head
 Please - ain't got no credit cards to feature now
 Just heart and soul
 Instead, believe me baby
 And let me roll
 I'm a circle in the corner
 I'm a one-man show
 If you get with me baby
 I'm gonna do it all
 I'm your fall in winter
 I'm a wanted sign
 And if you don't read me baby
 You might lose your mind
 Ain't got no rain no car toÂ ? baby
 I'll let you know
 Think ahead, believe me baby
 And let me roll
 Let me roll
 I'm not too proud to beg
 Please let me roll
 'Cause I'll be kickin' inside of your head
 I ain't got no credit cards to feature now
 Just heart and soul
 Think ahead, believe me baby
 And let me roll
 Don't play with time
 Don't play me
 Don't play the night, ah ah baby
 Don't make me say it again
 Get ready now
 Let me roll
 Let me roll
 Let me roll
 Let me roll
 Let me roll
 Let me roll
 Let me roll
 Let me roll
 Ain't got no rain no car no beauty baby
 Just heart and soul
 Ain't got no famous friends to talk about
 Just heart and soul
 Ain't got no credit cards to feature now
 Just heart and soul
 Instead, believe me baby
 Let me roll
 'Cause I'm not too proud to beg
 Please let me roll
 'Cause I'll be kickin' inside your head
 Please, I ain't got no Escalade to talk about
 Just heart and soul
 Think ahead, believe me baby
 Let me roll
