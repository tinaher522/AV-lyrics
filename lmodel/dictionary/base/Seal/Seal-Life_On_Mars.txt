<song artist="Seal" title="Life_On_Mars">
It's a God, awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No"
While her daddy has told her to go
Now, her friend is nowhere to be seen
As she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
As she walks to the silver screen
But the film is a saddenin' bore
'Cause she's watched it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beatin' up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
And the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog and clowns
But the film is a saddenin' bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beatin' up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best sellin' show
Is there life on Mars?
