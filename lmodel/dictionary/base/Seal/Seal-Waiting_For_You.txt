<song artist="Seal" title="Waiting_For_You">
Everyday, a shade of blue
You won't believe, what I'm goin through
It just feels like I can't afford to let myself go
Oh oh, nooo
Everyone, is just the same
They touch me, but I can't say
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
Heavenly, that's what you are
You're burning me, like a shining star
How am I supposed to be that king without you?
Oh oh it's true
Everyone, is just the same
They love me, but I can't say
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaa
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you 
(hey yea yea)
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
I have seen no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaaaa
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
(aaaaaa, for you, ba ba ba ba babaaaa, yea yea yea)
Everyday I sit down and I feel like I'm waiting
For you
I've been waiting for you
For you
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
