I get high when I touch ya...
Oooooo,
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
First you wanted to be free,
Now you must decide just what you want from me. 
Tell me then what kills if we,
Show all our love, 
Our love. 
Ya look good and-I, I feel fine.
Being low is a, a real high. 
Well I love you so,
It's alright and-I, 
Cain my brain,
Cain my brain. 
On your face there is a sign.
You need love just like I do-ooo.
Tell me can we give this much in time.
Oh, we carry on,
We can. 
Well-ya, ya look good and-I, I feel fine.
Being low is a, a real high. 
Well I love you so,
It's alright when-I, 
Cain my brain,
Wanna cain my brain,
Cain my brain,
Wanna cain my brain,
Things don't look the same. Oh naw. 
Well, ya look good and-I, I feel fine.
Well-a, being low is a, a real high. 
Well I, love you so,

Cain my brain
On a clear day,

If I tried I don't think I could end it better this way.
Wanna cain my brain
Oh, 'cause everything is, blue TV.
When I cain my brain
I don't look for it me. In me.
