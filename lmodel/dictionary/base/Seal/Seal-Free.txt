<song artist="Seal" title="Free">
Whispering in his ear
My magic potion to love
Telling him, I'm sincere
And that there's nothin' too good for us
And I've just got to be me, me, me
Whispering in his ear
My magic potion to love
Telling him, I'm sincere
And that there's nothin' too good for us
But I want to be free, free, free
And I've just got to be me yeah, me, me
Teasing hands on his mind
Give our nights such mistery
Happiness all the time
Oh and how that man pleases me
But I want to be free, free, free
And I've just got to be me, me, me
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba)
I've just got to be me
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba)
Feelin' you close to me
Makes all my senses smile
Let's not waste ecstasy
'Cause I'll only be here for a while
I've gotta be free, free, free, ohh
And I've just got to be me yeah, yeah, me, me
Free, free, free to be me
(I've just gotta be me)
And I just wanna, I just wanna be me
(I've just gotta be me)
I've just gotto be me, me
Ohh free
(I've just gotta be me)
I sware to my, I've gotto be me
