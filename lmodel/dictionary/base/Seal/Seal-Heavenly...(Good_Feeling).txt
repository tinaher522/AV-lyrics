<song artist="Seal" title="Heavenly...(Good_Feeling)">
Northern son
We're walking down that same avenue
Throw me a lifeline, won't you please
I'm watching the news, but I'm not at ease
Throw me a lifeline, won't you please
Come to the place where I used to play
And put on your peace wires for a day
Look at the radios in the sun
Can you let it pass you by?
Heavenly, can't you see?
Feels like yesterday's here now
Heavenly, trust in me
Feels like yesterday now
I look at the world and it's heavenly
I see a miracle place to be
Why is it anyone has to die?
Did they ever ask you why?
When will you talk about being free?
Pain isn't all that it's meant to be
Hanging another one out to dry
Is there any reason why?
Heavenly, can't you see?
Feels like yesterday's here now
Heavenly, trust in me
Feels like yesterday now...
Morning feeling
Feel like waking up again
Morning feeling
Feel like waking up again
Northern son
We're walking down that same avenue
I look at the world and it's heavenly
All of the things that it's meant to be
Some of the suffering all divine
Hearing Mother Nature cry
Love me a little more
I'm a survivor
I'll Love you a little more
I like staying alive
Why don't you show me a little more?
Hearing your mother call
Anyone can feel
Heavenly, can't you see?
'Cause it feels like yesterday's here now
Heavenly, trust in me
Feels like yesterday now
Heavenly...
