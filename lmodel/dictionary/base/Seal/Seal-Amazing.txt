<song artist="Seal" title="Amazing">
Everyone says you're amazing
Say you don't know how to do it now
So you run
It's not that you're bleeding, but you're through with it now
So you run, so you run
I know that you need it, you can't live alone
So you run, so you run
Everyone says you're amazing now that you're clean
Only you know who the real ones are cause you've seen
There's only one question I want to ask is it healing
When you hear everyone say you're amazing
Does anyone ask you?
Do you cry in your sleep and do you feel ok?
When you run
Thinking it's Doomsday you got to let it go
So you run, so you run
Pretend you don't see it, that we can live a lie
So you run, so you run
Everyone says you're amazing now that you're clean
Only you know who the real ones are 'cause you've seen
There's only one question I want to ask is it healing
When, when you hear everyone say you're amazing
Does anyone ask you?
Cause I know that you're real, amazing, amazing, amazing
Everyone says you're amazing now that you're clean
Only you know who the real ones are 'cause you've seen
There's only one question I want to ask is it healing
When you...
Everyone says you're amazing
Everyone says you're amazing
(I want you to always feel you're amazing)
Everyone says you're amazing
(I want you to always feel you're amazing)
Everyone says you're amazing
(I want you to always feel you're amazing)
(I want you to always feel you're amazing)
You're amazing
