<song artist="Seal" title="I_Am_Your_Man">
Rely on me to supply
Your needs from now on
Shelter you and be
A pillow to lean on
For in your eyes, I see
What I was born to ne
And now, now my life can begin
For I am your man
Oh, yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm your man
Listen, darling
There's no sacrifice great or small
I wouldn't do
My ambition is
Bringing happiness to you
And if troubles comes our way 
I'm gonna promise to stay
Right by your side
'Cause that's where I wanna stay
For I am your man
Oh, yes, I am, little darling
Little darling, I'm your man
My childish days are through
I wanna be someone you can look up to
Someone who can protect, oh
Someone who you can respect
I'm just trying to make myself worthy
Of the precious, precious love
I know you've been giving me
I want nothing more for myself
Your love is greatest wealth
And when you take my hand
And when you take my hand
You will proudly say
Oh, this is my man
Oh, yes, I am, little darling
Little darling, I'm your man
Oh, ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Yeah, hoo, I'm your man
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, baby, baby
