<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Steal_Away_(The_Night)">
Now I feel the time is right
Love will flow like wine tonight
Give your love and it will come to you
Yeah
If you feel that you and me
Could escape and hold the key
To a paradise that's true and free
Yeah
Steal away
Steal away
Steal away the night
You gotta steal it
C'mon baby
Now I've met your honesty
You are here and I am free
Broken chains have fallen all around
Yeah
Point my finger at the fools
Broken chains and broken rules
Let it be rebellion rules tonight
Yeah
Steal away
You gotta steal away
Steal away the night
Can it be a dream come true?
Now that I am here with you
Tearful eyes of joy is something new
Yeah
Run away with me tonight
Dream the dream, light the light
Happiness is what you give to me
Ooh, yeah
Steal away
Steal away
You gotta steal away the night
Steal away
Steal away
You gotta steal away the night
Steal away
Steal away
Steal away the night
