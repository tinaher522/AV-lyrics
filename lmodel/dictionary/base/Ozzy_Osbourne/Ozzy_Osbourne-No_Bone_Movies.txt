<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="No_Bone_Movies">
Silver screen such a disgrace
I couldn't look her straight in the face
A foolish picture, I live in disgust
Degradation being eaten by lust
No bone movies
No bone movies
No bone movies
Inspiration that's blue and uncut
Can't kick the habit, obsession of smut
Voyeur straining in love with his hand
A poison passion, a pulsating gland
No bone movies
No bone movies
No bone movies
Flaps
I shouldn't do it, the guilt tells me why
I just can't stop it, I try and I try
X-rated demon that lives in my head
Hungry for bodge and he wants to be fed
No bone movies
No bone movies
No bone movies
No No, No bone movies
No No, No bone movies
No No, No bone movies
Yeah, yeah, no bone movies tonight
(No bone movies) No bone movies tonight
(No bone movies) No movies tonight
(No bone movies) No, no, no, no
(No bone movies) Wooh
(No bone movies) Alright, let's go
(No bone movies) No, no
(No bone movies) No, no
(No bone movies) No, no
(No bone movies) No bone movies
(No bone movies) Yeah, c'mon
(No bone movies) No, no
(No bone movies)
