<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Tattooed_Dancer">
Well she's a mean hard woman and she knows what she wants
She's my tattooed rock 'n' roll dancer
I'm under her thumb and when she tells me to come
Oh hi's the only way I can answer
They're gonna put me away
Put me away
Goddamn them
Well I can hear her moaning like a dog that's in heat
She never takes no for an answer
she's driving me mad, she makes it good to be bad
My little tattooed rock 'n' roll dancer
They try to put me away
Put me away
Goddamn them
They'll never put me away
Put me away
My soul's on fire
Tattooed dancer
Dance for me bitch
I think I'm in grave danger, goin' over the top
There is no question only and answer
She can't give me love, I think I've fallen in lust
With my tattooed rock 'n' roll dancer
They'll never put me away
Put me away
Goddamn them
They'll never put me away
Put me away
My soul's on fire
They'll never put me away
My soul's on fire
