<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="The_Ultimate_Sin">
Overkill, enough is enough
There's nothing left of me to devour
You've had your fill, I'm all I have left
What can stop your hunger for power
'Cause you took advantage of things that I said
Now the feeling is dead
And that's the ultimate sin
And that's the ultimate sin
Anyway, I look at it now
The doors are closed and cannot be opened
Bury your anger and bury your dead
Or you'll be left with nothing and no one
There's no point in screaming
'Cause you won't be heard
Now that tables have turned
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin
I warned you then
And I'm warning you now
If you mess with me, you're playing with fire
Winds of change that are fanning the flames
Will carry you to your funeral pyre
It's pulling you down, it's your final descent
It's too late to repent
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
