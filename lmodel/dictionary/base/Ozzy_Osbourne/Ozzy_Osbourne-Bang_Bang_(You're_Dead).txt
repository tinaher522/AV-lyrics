<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Bang_Bang_(You're_Dead)">
Head for the hills, there's a firestorm coming
Where are you going to hide?
Watching the grains of the hourglass falling
Clutching the hands of time
Preachers sell god for money
Cause everything has a price
American milk and honey
I'll never be bitten twice
Bang bang you're dead
So come and join the living
More tears are shed
Don't be the unforgiven
Bang bang you're dead
Watching tv but the ads are better
Craving for passion online
Blaming the crimes on a video horror
It's happening all of the time
Military rules and honor
They're playing games with your head
Sycophant schools and scholars
Will sell the death to the dead
Bang bang you're dead
So come and join the living
More tears are shed
Don't be the unforgiven
Bang bang you're dead
(And I saw 17,000 kids which raised their hands like this,
Which is the sign of the devil, and they said Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy...)
Preachers sell god for money
They're playing games with your head
American milk and honey
Will sell the death to the dead
Bang bang you're dead
So come and join the living
More tears are shed
Don't be the unforgiven
Bang bang you're dead
