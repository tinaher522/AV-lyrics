<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Life_Won't_Wait">
I watch it all change
Take the news of the day
And throw it away
Time will kill all the pain
Fate will cure the decay of all this blind ambition
The greed brings us together
Stay strong!
Stay true!
Be brave!
It all comes down to you!
Try to just let it go
Know that justice moves slow
But it comes in the end
Rise, the guilty will fall
Stay, they can't take it all
They want the unimportant
It's love they leave behind
Stand up!
Aim true!
Keep heart!
The future looks to you!
Every second you throw away
Every minute of every day
Don't get caught in a memory
Because life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you
My friend
I'm watching the change
Who will carry the flame?
It all feels very strange
Dreams that men can be good
Faith to live as we should
And know that we are all connected
We give ourselves the power
Stay strong!
Stay true!
Be brave!
It all comes down to you!
Every day, that you wait
You're falling faster!
No slight of hand, no twist of fate
No ever after!
When it's gone it's gone
A fight 'til the bitter end!
Life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you
My friend
(interlude)
Life won't wait for you
My friend
Life won't wait for you
My friend
Life won't wait for you
My friend
Life won't wait for you
My friend
