<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Facing_Hell">
You made a promise of protection
To a future after life
To the final resurrection
Unto eternal paradise
But then I'm blinded with temptation
Into every mortal sin
Is it God that sits there waiting
Or will the darkness suck me in?
Let's wake up the dead, oh yeah
It's better than never, you know
More tears are shed, oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell 
Oh, the children sit and listen
The belief was in their eyes
In a land with no tomorrows
Through the night, you hear their cries
But then your eyes just skip the pages
Of a book that never ends
Is it God that sits there waiting
Do you hear the call again?
Let's wake up the dead, oh yeah
It's better than never, you know
More tears are shed, oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell
It's just a crazy world we live in and I'm out of my mind
You'll pray tomorrow but you're leaving today
Evil one is coming and he's knocking your door
'Cause today's the day you pay 
Let's wake up the dead, oh yeah
It's better than never, you know
More tears are shed, oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
Let's wake up the dead, oh yeah
It's better than never, you know
More tears are shed, oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell
That I'm facing hell
That I'm facing hell
That I'm facing hell
