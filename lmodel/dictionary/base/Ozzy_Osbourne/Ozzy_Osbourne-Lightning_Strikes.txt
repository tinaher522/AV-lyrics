<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Lightning_Strikes">
Won't you listen
'Cos I'm at it again
Lightning striking and on that you can depend
They say that lightning never strikes the same place twice
Gods of thunder sit and watch the event
You know I take no prisoners
My back's to the wall
You know I must be going
When destiny calls
Until I feel that thunder shattering my brain
I won't stop
Rockin' all night, rockin' all night
Until the lightning strikes again
Rockin' all night, rockin' all night
Until the lightning strikes again
Tell your mamma that you're gonna be late
But not to worry we'll just be rockin' all night
The lighting strikes before you hear the thunder roar
We're becoming the children of the night
I'm not apologizing
I am what I am
There is no compromising
I don't give a damn
Until I feel the thunder boiling in my veins
I won't stop
Rockin' all night, rockin' all night
Until the lightning strikes again
Rockin' all night, rockin' all night
Until the lightning strikes again
Oh no I've lost control
Here we go
It's only rock 'n' roll
The silver light is flashing
As all turns to gold
In my head voice screaming
And I'm being told
If you will only listen you will hear them too
I won't stop
Rockin' all night, rockin' all night
Until the lightning strikes again
Rockin' all night, rockin' all night
Until the lightning strikes again
