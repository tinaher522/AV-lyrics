<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="21st_Century_Schizoid_Man">
Cat's foot iron claw
Neurosurgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
21st Century Schizoid Man
Blood rack barbed wire
Politicians' funeral pyre
Innocents raped with napalm fire
21st Century Schizoid Man
Twenty first century
Twenty first century
Twenty first century
21st Century Schizoid Man
Death seed blind man's greed
Poets' starving children bleed
Nothing he's got he really needs
21st Century Schizoid Man
Twenty first century
21st Century Schizoid Man
21st Century Schizoid Man
Welcome to the twenty first century... hahaha
