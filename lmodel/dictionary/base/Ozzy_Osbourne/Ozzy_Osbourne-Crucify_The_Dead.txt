<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Crucify_The_Dead">
The fire started long ago
The flames burned out, still embers glow
So charred and black
There's nothing left to burn, to burn
We had the same dream
Lived life to extreme
A loaded gun jammed by a rose
The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah
The future is unset in stone
Decisions past leave you alone
Betrayed us all with your own selfish greed, your greed, yeah
New soldiers now say
That your beggars collect
Re-crucified and paid by you
The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah
We were like brothers with the world in our hands
You always have too much to say
Someday you look back and you wonder why
You let it all slip away, yeah
Crucify the dead
Crucify the dead
The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah
