<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Mississippi_Queen">
Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything
Way down around Vicksburg, 'round Louisiana way
There lived the Cajun lady, aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine
Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything
This lady she asked me, if I would be her man
You know what I told her, I would do what I can
To keep her lookin' pretty, buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were makin' their bread
Buddy, I beg your pardon, I was losin' mine
I was losin' my mind on the Mississippi Queen
Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything
Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun lady, aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer. she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Brother, beg your pardon, I was getting mine
I was getting mine
I was gettin' mine
No, you can't have mine (no, you can't get mine)
No no, you can't have mine (no, you can't get mine)
No no, you can't have mine (no, you can't get mine)
To keep a Mississippi queen
