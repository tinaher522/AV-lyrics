<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="I_Don't_Know">
People look to me and say
Is the end near, when is the final day?
What's the future of mankind?
How do I know, I got left behind
Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me, I don't know
How am I supposed to know
Hidden meanings that will never show
Fools and prophets from the past
Life's a stage and we're all in the cast
You gotta believe in someone 
Asking me who is right
Asking me who to follow
Don't ask me, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Nobody ever told me, I found out for myself
You gotta believe in foolish miracles
It's not how you play the game, it's if you win or lose 
You can choose
Don't confuse
Win or lose
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
Go, go, go
People look to me and say
Is the end near, when is the final day?
What's the future of mankind?
How do I know, I got left behind, I'm lost
Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me, I don't know
