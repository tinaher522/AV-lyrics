<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Suicide_Solution">
Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows
Away tomorrows
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone, you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the master keeper
'Cause you feel life's unreal
And you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame
And you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask
"Is there life after birth?"
What you sow can mean hell on this earth
Hell on this earth
Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's travelling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The reaper's you and the reaper is me
Breaking laws, knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Make your bed, rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide? Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about
I know, people
Aah,ahh you got it, you got it
Wow wow wow, get the flaps out!
Satan satan satan
Ha ha ha ha
Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows
Take me away
Tomorrow
