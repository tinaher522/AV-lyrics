<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Center_Of_Eternity">
There's no present, there's no future
I don't even know about the past
It's all timeless and never ending
And to take it in, it's all too vast
It goes forever and ever
You thought, you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
The time is coming but also going
And it's leaving never to return
And maybe heaven could be forever
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn
It goes forever and ever
You thought, you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
I got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavor
But forever is a long long time
There's no secrets and no corruption
In the center of infinity
There's no limits in non-existence
And no beginning to my destiny
It goes forever and ever
You thought, you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
