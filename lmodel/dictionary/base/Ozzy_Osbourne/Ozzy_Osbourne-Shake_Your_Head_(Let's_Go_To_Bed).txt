<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Shake_Your_Head_(Let's_Go_To_Bed)">
You can't argue with death
Can't break a burly sailor's neck
You can't drink lava from plastic glasses
And you can't influence the masses
Can't tune a radio to heaven
You can't live seven lives
You can't win money at the horses
And you can't fight the armed forces
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Let's go to bed
You can't feed the hungry
Can't talk shakespeare to a monkey
You can't ban the bomb
And there's no way to stay calm
You can't sue buddah for libel
You can't rewrite the bible
You can't hit homers like babe ruth
And yan't put your finger on the truth
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Let's go to bed
Ooh, uhuh
And you can't influence
And you can't influence
And you can't influence
Mmm, let's go to bed
You can't sing underwater
You can't have the boss' daughter
You can't make missles out of mud
You can't purify bad blood
You can't feed hungry
You can't pretend to have fun
You can't read a robot's mind
Can't expect vultures to be kind
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed
Ooh, let's go to bed
