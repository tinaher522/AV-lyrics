<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Time_After_Time">
Time after time
I guess that love is blind
I couldn't read you mind
Line after line
Line after line
It was written in your eyes
I guess it's no surprise
Time after time
I can hear them whispering
Shadows in the rain
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time
Line after line
You broke me
Day after day
I watched love fade away
I wanted love to stay
Day after day
The games we play
The foolish things we say
The pain won't go away
Day after day
Candlelight is shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been
Day after day
The games we play you broke me
Candlelight is shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time
Line after line
You broke me
Time after time
Line after line
You broke me
