<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="11_Silver">
Your words, they go right through me
They circle round my head, yeah
I cant believe I'm still here
I know I should be dead, yeah
This desperation makes me feel so filthy
But I know If I don't stop I wont feel guilty
Take me higher
Crank me faster
Help me get
The thrill I'm after
One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One shot to keep me high all day
makes my reality fade away
There is no future waiting
There is no morning after
Can't stop obsessive craving
An itch I just can't scratch - yeah 
This paranoia stops my mind from sleeping 
I don't know if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming 
Take me in 
You won't deny me 
Spit me out 
All bright and shiny 
One time to take away all pain 
One more to turn myself insane
One shot to keep me high all day
makes my reality fade away
One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One shot to keep me high all day
makes my reality fade away
