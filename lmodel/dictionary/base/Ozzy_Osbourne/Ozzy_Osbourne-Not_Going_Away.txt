<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Not_Going_Away">
Don't tell me I'm wrong
Don't tell me that you knew all along
I won't roll over dead
Only I know what goes on in my head
I've got nothing to hide
I'm not guilty inside
I won't give up
After all I'm still crazy
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Tried so hard to break me
But all your diamonds turn to sand
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
Get out of my way
There's nothing you can do to change what I say
I won't ever let go
I've got the answer, but you'll never know
I've got my eyes open wide
Ain't gonna slip up or slide
Can't take me down
After all I'm still crazy
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Tried so hard to break me
But all your diamonds turn to sand
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
(I'm not going away) {8x}
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Tried so hard to break me
But all your diamonds turn to sand
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
I'm not going away {3x}
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
