<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Flying_High_Again">
Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Got a crazy feeling I don't understand
Gotta get away from here
Feelin' like I should have kept my feet on the ground
Waitin' for the sun to appear
Momma's gonna worry
I been a bad bad boy
No use sayin' sorry
It's something that I enjoy
'Cause you can't see what my eyes see
(I can see it, I can see it)
And you can't be inside of me
Flying high again
I can see through mountains, watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
Swallowing colours of the sound I hear
Am I just a crazy guy?  You bet
Momma's gonna worry
I been a bad bad boy
No use sayin' sorry
It's something that I enjoy
If you could be inside my head
You'd see that black and white is read
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Come on and join me
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Come on and join me
Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Daddy thinks I'm lazy, he don't understand
Never saw inside my head
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand
Never heard a thing I said
Momma's gonna worry
I been a bad bad boy
No use sayin' sorry
It's something that I enjoy
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
