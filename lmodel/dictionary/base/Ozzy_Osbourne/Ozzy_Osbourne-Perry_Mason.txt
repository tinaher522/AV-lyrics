<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Perry_Mason">
On his way to dinner when it took him by surprise
And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
Then a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife
I don't mind
Single file down the runway
Feelin' fine
And I'll see you my friend
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again, again
Riding painted horses, oh the kids, they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business, like my mamma always said
But if I don't try to help 'em, they could wind up on the front page
I don't mind
Draw the line, then draw me an arrow
Feelin' fine
Then I'll see you my friend
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again, again
Wake me when it's over
Tell me it's all right
Just keep on talking, baby
I've been doing this all night
How much did you give me?
Tell me it'll be all right
Then I'll see you my friend
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again, again, again
