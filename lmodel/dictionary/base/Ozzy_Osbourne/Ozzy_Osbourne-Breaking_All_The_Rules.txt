<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Breaking_All_The_Rules">
Well, I know
I could be just another stranger
But to you
I guess I'm just another fool
And you swear
You like to live your life in danger
Then you hide
Behind a wall of silly rules
Nobody thinks the way I do
I guess that nobody dares
Your head's so full of things
So set your mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules
Breaking all the rules
Can't you see they're nothing without you?
Empty heads full of fool
Now you see, I'm breakin' the rules
Did you know
That in the truth there's nothing stranger?
I suppose
You think I think I know it all
Nobody hears the things I say
I guess that nobody cares
My head's so full of things
I'll set my mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules
Breaking all the rules
Can't you see they're nothing without you
Empty heads full of fool
Now you see
I'm breakin' all the rules, breakin' all the rules
Well, I know
That you would love to go to heaven
But you know
That you're just too afraid to die
And I know
That you would love to know the answers
But to you
The truth is just another lie
Nobody hears the things I say
I guess nobody cares
My head's so full of things
I set my mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules
Breaking all the rules
Can't you see they're nothing without you
Empty heads full of fools
Now you see
I'm breaking all the rules, breaking all the rules
Breaking all the rules
Why don't you tell them now
Breaking all the rules
Now come on, now come on
Breaking all the rules
Why don't you get it on
Breaking all the rules
Now come on, now come on
Breaking all the rules
Ahh
Breaking all the rules
Now come on, now come on
Breaking all the rules
All right now
Breaking all the rules
Sh-sh-shake it now
Breaking all the rules
A-come on, now come on
Breaking all the rules
Now let me tell you now
Breaking all the rules
Let's go crazy
Breaking all the rules
Now come on, now come on, yeah
