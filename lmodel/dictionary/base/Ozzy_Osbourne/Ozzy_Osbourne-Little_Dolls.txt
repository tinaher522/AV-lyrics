<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Little_Dolls">
Wrything and screaming
The pain just won't go
He'll show you no mercy
Your image in his hands
It's useless to try
Escaping his curses
The pins and needles
Prick the skin of little dolls
Tortured and flaming
You give birth to hell
Living a nightmare
It's a pity
You'll pray for your death
But he's in no hurry
The pins and needles
Prick the skin of little dolls
Nowhere to run
Your fate is in his hands
Your time has come
You'll live to his command
I'm warning you
The worst is yet to come
The killer who
Remains a mystery
I that believe in the stories of old
Would never fight it
Demons and curses that play on our soul
Like something ignited
You never imagined such a fate could follow you
You never thought it was true
And when it's your time
I wonder how you'll do
Your kind of trouble's running deeper than the sea
You broke the rules
You've been a fool
The little doll is you, yeah
Nowhere to run
Your fate is in his hands
Your time has come
You'll live to his command
I'm warning you
The worst is yet to come
The killer who
Remains a mystery
Wrything and screaming
The pain just won't go
He'll show you no mercy
Your image in his hands
It's useless to try
Escaping his curses
Nowhere to run
Your fate is in his hands
Your time has come
You'll live to his command
I'm warning you
The worst is yet to come
The killer who
Remains a mystery
