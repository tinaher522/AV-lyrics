<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Dreamer">
Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will Mother Earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her
Sometime
After all there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself
Time after time
I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days
I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us
This time
I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days
Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream, a fantasy, oh yeah yeah yeah
If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry
Be gone?
I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away today
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer
Who's searching for the way, today
I'm just a dreamer
Dreaming my life away
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
