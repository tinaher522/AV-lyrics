<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Stillborn">
Blind me, erased what was
Stillborn I have become
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long
So empty, just a shell of a man
Stillborn, this I understand
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long
