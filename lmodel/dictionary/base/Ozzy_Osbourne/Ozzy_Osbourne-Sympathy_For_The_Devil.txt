<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Sympathy_For_The_Devil">
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long time
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Oh, pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted, who killed the Kennedys?
After all it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I laid traps for the troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
Ow, wooh
Ha ha ha ha
Oh
Every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners are saints
Heads is tails, call me Lucifer
I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh
What's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?
I am Lucifer, hahahaha
Ow, wooh
Alright you motherfuckers
What's my name?
What's my name?
Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby, come on baby, oh
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I am the Devil's own
There can only be one devil, so one of us must go.
