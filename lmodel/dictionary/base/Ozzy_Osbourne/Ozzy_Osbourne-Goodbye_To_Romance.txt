<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Goodbye_To_Romance">
Yesterday has been and gone
Tomorrow will I find the sun
Or will it rain
Everybody's having fun
Except me, I'm the lonely one
I live in shame
I say
Goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end
I've been the king
I've been the clown
No broken wings can hold me down
I'm free again
The jester with a broken crown
It won't be me this time around
To love in vain
I say
Goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I'll tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end
And I feel the time is right
Although I know that you just might
Say to me
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do
But I had to take this chance goodbye
To friends and to romance
And to all of you
And to all of you
Come on now
I say
Goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I'll tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end
And the weather's looking fine
And I think the sun will shine again
And I feel I've cleared my mind
All the past is left behind again
Goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I'll tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end
