<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Wake_The_Dead">
How many more will cross my path
How many more must die
I never wonder where they come from
I never wonder why
You don't know what's going on inside of me
You don't wanna know what's running through my mind, yeah yeah yeah
(Sick.... Sick...)
You wake up every morning thinking everything's okay
But if by chance you walk my way you just may seal your fate
Give me a redhead, give me a brunette, send a blonde to me
When I unwind I'm colour blind, they're all the same to me
(Sick.... Sick...)
Shake my head, wake the dead
Shake my head, wake the dead
Run for your life, you better run for your life
Run for your life, you gotta run for your life
I just do the things I do, it's natural to me
There's no rhyme or reason for my odd insanity
You don't know what's going on inside of me
You don't wanna know what's going through my mind, yeah yeah yeah
Shake my head, wake the dead
Shake my head, wake the dead
Shake my head, wake the dead
Shake my head, wake the dead
Run for your life you better run for your life
Run for your life you gotta run for your life
(you gotta.... you gotta.... you gotta.... you gotta....
You gotta.... wake up wake up, you gotta.... wake up wake up,
Wake up wake up, wake up wake up, wake up wake up,
Wake up wake up, wake up wake up, wake up wake up,
Wake up wake up)
