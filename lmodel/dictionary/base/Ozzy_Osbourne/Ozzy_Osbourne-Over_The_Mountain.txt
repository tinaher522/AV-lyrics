<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Over_The_Mountain">
Over the mountain, take me across the sky
Something in my visions, something deep inside
Where did I wander, where d'ya think I wandered to
I've seen life's magic, astral plane I travel through
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars
And said I'd show them how
Over and over, always tried to get away
Living in a daydream, only place I had to stay
Fever of a breakout, burning in me miles wide
People around me talking to the walls inside
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars
And said I'd show them how
Don't need no astrology
It's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to fly with me
I'm free, yeah
Over and under, in between the ups and downs
My mind a carpet, magic ride goes 'round and 'round
Over the mountain, kissing silver inlaid clouds
Watching my body disappear into the crowds
Don't need no astrology
It's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to fly with me
I'm free, yeah
