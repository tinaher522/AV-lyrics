<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="I_Don't_Wanna_Stop">
I don't know what they're talking about
I'm making my own decisions
This thing that I found ain't gonna bring me down
I'm like a junkie without an addiction
Mama don't cry, I just wanna stay high
Like playing with danger or fear
Everybody's walking but nobody's talking
It looks a lot better from here
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me
I don't wanna stop
Why don't they ever listen to me?
It's just a one-way conversation
Nothing they say is gonna set me free
Don't need no mental masturbation
Too many religions, but only one God
I don't need another saviour
Don't try to change my mind, you know I'm one of a kind
Ain't gonna change my bad behavior
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me
I don't wanna stop
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me
I don't wanna stop
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me
I don't wanna stop
