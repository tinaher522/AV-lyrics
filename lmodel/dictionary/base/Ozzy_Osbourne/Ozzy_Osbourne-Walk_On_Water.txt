<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Walk_On_Water">
I met a magic man
Who had a daughter
She learned her lessons well,
But still I taught her
She followed willingly
As lambs to slaughter
We shared forbidden fruits,
And things I brought her
You may say I'm a miracle mannequin,
Here I come with my mystical plan again,
Although you think I can, I'm just a man
And I don't walk on water
Oh no
I don't walk on water
Oh no
I followed willingly
A sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized
And still I'm waiting
My dromedary dreams
As wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds
She set in motion
You may say I'm a cynical charlatan
There I go with my whimsical ways again
Although you think I can, I'm just a man
And I don't walk on water 
Oh no
I don't walk on water 
Oh no
I don't walk on water 
Oh no
I don't walk on water 
Oh no
Kaliedoscopial eyes as you look in the mirror
And the long is getting shorter as the far is now nearer
Are you just a mirror standing in front of me?
Am I blind?
Can my eyes really see?
You may say I'm a miracle mannequin
Here I come with my mystical plan again
Although you think I can I'm just a man
And I don't walk on water 
Oh no
I don't walk on water 
Oh no
I don't walk on water 
Oh no
I don't walk on water 
Oh no
My dromedary dreams
As wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds
She set in motion
My dromedary dreams
My dromedary dreams
My dromedary dreams
