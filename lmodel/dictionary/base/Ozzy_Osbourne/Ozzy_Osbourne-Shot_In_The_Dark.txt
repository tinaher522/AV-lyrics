<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Shot_In_The_Dark">
Out on the street
I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill
But it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them
I can hear them 
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right
Taught by the powers
That preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen
I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded
And when it's too late
They'll remember
They'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right
But just like the wounded
And when it's too late
They'll remember
They'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark
