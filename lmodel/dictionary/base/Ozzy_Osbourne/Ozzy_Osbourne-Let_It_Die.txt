<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Let_It_Die">
I'm a rock star, I'm a dealer
I'm a servant, I'm a leader
I'm a savior, I'm a sinner
I'm a killer, I'll be anything you want me to be
Silent, as a witness
Make your heart race, with a death kiss
I'm a soldier, in a blood war
In the peace corp, I am everything you will ever be
A loser, number zero
Play the victim, end up a hero
I'm a teacher, preacher, liar 
I am anything, everything
A mover, and a shaker
The oppressor, stimulator
I'm a coward, I'm a fighter (yeah)
I'm everything
You are me, I am you
Everything is breaking, no mistaking, it's all changing
Tear it down, watch it all start burning
All that's done is done, just let it lie
It's a revelation, celebration, graduation
Times collide, watch the world awaken
All the past regrets from days gone by
Let it go, let it die
It's a new day, for the faceless
Take the torches, from the useless
First amendment, second guesses
Are all dependent, I'll do anything to help you
Fallen crosses, new alliance
Deeper thinkers, modern science
Open guest list, all inclusive
No one loses, everything you always wanted
Honest answers, for the bruises
Full disclosure, no excuses
Open handshake, clean slate
No hate, living history
Misery, information, revolution
Loading up for execution
Push the button, pull the trigger (yeah), I'm everything
You are me, I am you
Everything is breaking, no mistaking, it's all changing
Tear it down and watch it all start burning
All that's done is done, just let it lie
It's a revelation, celebration, graduation
Times collide, watch the world awaken
All the past regrets from days gone by
Let it go, let it die
(Guitar Solo)
Everything is breaking, no mistaking, it's all changing
Tear it down and watch it all start burning
All that's done is done, just let it lie
It's a revelation, celebration, graduation
Times collide, watch the world awaken
All the past regrets from days gone by
Let it go, let it die
