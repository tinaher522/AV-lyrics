IRON MAN
Has he lost his mind? 
Can he see or is he blind? 
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall? 
Is he alive or dead? 
Has he thoughts within his head? 
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care? 
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again!
CHILDREN OF THE GRAVE
Revolution in their minds - the children start to march 
Against the world in which they have to live 
and all the hate that's in their hearts 
They're tired of being pushed around 
and told just what to do 
They'll fight the world until they've won 
and love comes flowing through 
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today 
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way? 
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear? 
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? 
So you children of the world, 
listen to what I say 
If you want a better place to live in 
spread the words today 
Show the world that love is still alive 
you must be brave 
Or you children of today are 
Children of the Grave, Yeah!
