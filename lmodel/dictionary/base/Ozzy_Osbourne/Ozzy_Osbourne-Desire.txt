<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Desire">
I've always knew what I wanted to be
I knew for sure, I knew for sure
Always knew it was them or me
I wanted more, more and more
It's all right, it's okay
None of them people gonna take it away
They don't know like I know
And I can't stop 'cause it drives them crazy
It drives them crazy
'Cause I won't be cool
It's too late baby
It's the same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain, oh yeah
Always moving, somewhere else to be
Moving on, moving on
Scream at you and you scream at me
Right or wrong, right or wrong
It's all right, it's okay
No one's ever gonna take us away
'Cause they don't know like I know
I gotta keep rockin', 'cause it makes me crazy
It makes me crazy
Who needs to be cool?
Life's amazing
It's the same old desire
Crazy train, crazy train
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain
Same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain, oh yeah
It's the same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain
Same old desire
Crazy train, crazy train
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain
