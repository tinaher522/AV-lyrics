<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Diggin'_Me_Down">
You're saving the saved, men and women enslaved
Propagating the messiah conception
The rich getting richer, paint you into their picture
Give the poor immaculate deception
Where are you father?
Why don't you save us?
The fallen are dying alone
How can you turn off their cries?
Ignore a new genocide?
So come on, Jesus
We're all here waiting just for you
How long must we keep on waiting?
The faithful and blind are keepin' me keepin' me down
How long, 'cause my faith is breaking
The pure and divine are diggin' me diggin' me down
Do you live in the light?
Or in the dead of the night?
Sanctimonious promises broken
Hypocritical sin
Dying slowly within
Is the sacred truth forever unspoken?
Life ever after, bohemian rapture
Beware the dark side of the son
You're just a self-made messiah
Selling brimstone and fire
So come on Jesus 
Don't keep us waiting here for you
How long must we keep on waiting?
The faithful and blind are bringin' me bringin' me down
How long, 'cause my faith is breaking
The pure and divine are diggin' me diggin' me down
How will I know you mister Jesus Christ?
Have you already been here once or twice?
The son of man or obsolete facade?
How will I know that you're the son of God?
