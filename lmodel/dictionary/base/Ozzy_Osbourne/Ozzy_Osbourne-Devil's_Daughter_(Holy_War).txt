<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Devil's_Daughter_(Holy_War)">
Well I know where you live
I know you live alone
I'll pay a visit in your darkest hour
I've got a treat in store
Won't be the same no more
And I will demonstrate my holy power
I see through
What it is inside you
I'll make you breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown and cry
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
You know what I'm about
I'll cast the demons out
And I'll persist until the battle's won
I'll feel your creeping flesh
If you're to be possessed
Then I will desecrate what you've become
I see through
What it is inside you
I'll make you breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown and cry
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
The time has come at last
Your future days have past
No use in fighting battles you can't win
The final conflict's lost
You can't afford the cost
Don't try to expiate your father's sins
I see through
What it is inside you
I'll make you breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown and cry
Breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown and cry
D-d-d-Devil's daughter
(I'm watching you, watching you)
D-d-d-Devil's daughter
(I'm watching you, watching you)
D-d-d-Devil's daughter
(I'm watching you, watching you)
D-d-d-Devil's
Ahhahahahaha
