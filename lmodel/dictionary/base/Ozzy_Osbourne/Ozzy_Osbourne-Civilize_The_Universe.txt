<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Civilize_The_Universe">
Bombs exploding, and tears are flowing, chasing rockets and gasping for air
You can call it justice or retribution, yet the reasons are never clear
Freedom is just man's invention and a soldier is just a slave
Self inflicted, so addicted, bad habits are hard to break
I'm alive
Watching better turn to worse
One more time
Try to civilize the universe
Without the righteous, without the faithful, we would never accept the obscene
A false confession, a priest's obsession gives the demon a light to be seen
Burn the witch and hang deserters, there's only one choice to be made
We're thought restricted, and herd afflicted, the truth is so hard to take
I'm alive
Watching better turn to worse
One more time
Try to civilize the universe
The righteous and the faithful
Give the deaf man to the blind
The world full of confusion
From a disease of the mind
I'm alive
Watching better turn to worse
One more time
Try to civilize the universe
I'm alive
Watching better turn to worse
One more time
Try to civilize the universe
Try to civilize the universe
