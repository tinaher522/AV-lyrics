Waiting for darkness
Why doesn't anybody see now
Deafened by silence
Why doesn't anybody hear?
I'm waiting for darkness
Playing with fire
But they're screaming when they're burned, yeah
Out of the sunlight
Hasn't anybody learned?
I know what they'll find
It's in their mind
It's what they want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
Promise me rebirth
And then you tear me from the womb
Give me my freedom
And then you lock me in a tomb
I know what they'll find
It's in their mind
It's what they want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay waiting for darkness
You gotta believe
You gotta believe it's true
I'm waiting for darkness
I just can't conceive
Why darkness is overdue
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
Who knows the answers?
Is it friend or is it foe?
Don't ask me questions
There are things you should not know
I know what you'll find
It's in your mind
It's what you want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
