<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Demon_Alcohol">
I'm sick and tired of you excuses
Can't deal with living anymore
I'll give you reasons to continue
While you lie writhing on the floor
I'll wash away your lies
And have you hypnotized
They'll be no compromise today
I'll share your life of shame
I think you know my name
I'll introduce myself today
I'm the demon alcohol, demon alcohol
I'll get you
If you could deal with your reflection
I'm sure you'd see into my eyes
There'll be no need for resurrection
Let's drink to people of the lies
Although that one's too much
You know ten's not enough
They'll be no compromise today
I'll watch you lose control
Consume your very soul
I'll introduce myself today
I'm demon alcohol, demon alcohol, ha ha
Demon alcohol, demon alcohol
Let's party
I'm demon alcohol
I'm demon alcohol
I'm sick and tired of resolutions
You've quit me time and time again
Don't speak of suicide solutions
You took my hand, I'm here to stay
This time it's you or me
I'll never set you free
There'll be no compromise today
So satisfy your lust
Too much can't be enough
I'll introduce myself today
I'm demon alcohol, demon alcohol, ha ha
Demon alcohol, demon alcohol
Let's party
