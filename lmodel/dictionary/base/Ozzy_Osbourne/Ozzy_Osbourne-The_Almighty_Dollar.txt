<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="The_Almighty_Dollar">
It's in the lives that we lead
Setup for money and greed
A little isn't enough we have to use it all up
Success, excess, the truth is inconvenient
Oh hang your head
Pillaged and left us for dead
You kept us blind and mislead
How could you think nothing's wrong
You won't be smiling for long
When it's all gone, gone
We can never go back
Burn into the air and atmosphere
Watching the rain come down
Turn your head away ignore the fear
Watching the ice crash down
Our father's justice gets closer
How could you screw us all over
Rape, steal and murder
God bless the almighty dollar
The almighty dollar
Poison the air that we breathe
Chained to industrial need
Destroy the souls that you steal, the radiation is real
Debate, too late, you've built our funeral pyre
You kill my faith
Mother earth, desecrate
Deceive the whole human race
I know you think nothing's wrong
We won't be breathing for long
When it's all gone, gone
We can never go back
Burn into the air and atmosphere
Watching the rain come down
Turn your head away ignore the fear
Watching the ice crash down
Our father's justice gets closer
How could you fuck us all over
Rape, steal and murder
God bless the almighty dollar
Death, doom and disaster
The point of no return
No earthly life ever after
Is it too late to learn?
Burn into the air and atmosphere
Watching the rain come down
Turn your head away ignore the fear
Watching the ice crash down
Our father's justice gets closer
How could you fuck us all over
Rape, steal and murder
God bless the almighty dollar
The almighty dollar
