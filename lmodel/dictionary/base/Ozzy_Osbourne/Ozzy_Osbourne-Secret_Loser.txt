<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Secret_Loser">
Trapped in a lonely body
I'm losing control
Can't show my emotions
And I'm losing my soul
Could it be that I'm obsessed with feeding my disease
I couldn't make it know the hidden things no one sees
Yeah
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Fighting a losing battle
Pretending to win
Repenting to holy unknowns
Pretending to sin
All I do is hide the wounds where blood just won't congeal
Couldn't ever take my soul 'cos it isn't there to steal
Yeah, Loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Though I'm the loser
There is no winner
There's nothing left to win
The hidden reasons
Now in deletion
Are lost in sin
So heed my warning
The time is dawning
I'll tell you here's the twist
The truth is lying
Below the surface
I don't exist
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Seeing is not believing
It don't mean a thing
Although it appears to be that
The loser is king
I can understand that what you see
You think is real
But underneath the surface is a wound
That cannot heal
Yeah, loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
Loser, I'm a secret loser
