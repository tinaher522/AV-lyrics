<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Bloodbath_In_Paradise">
Your comin' home
There's blood on the walls
And Charlie and the family made house calls
If you're alone
Then watch what you do
'Cause Charlie and the family might get you, yeah
Can you hear them in the darkness?
Helter Skelter, spiral madness, yeah
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's no where you can run to, baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise
California sun
But you're still in bed
And the California rain is turning red
No sign of life
Or the keepers of doom
In Charlie and the keeper's scarlet room, yeah
Can you hear them in the darkness?
Helter Skelter, spiral madness, yeah
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's no where you can run to, baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise
They'll summon you
To wake from the dead
As you lie bleeding, murdered in your bed
The sweetest dreams
Are all in your mind (in your mind)
But no one wakes when Charlie creeps behind, yeah
Execution halts your breath
Helter Skelter, spiral death, yeah
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's no where you can break out, baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise
