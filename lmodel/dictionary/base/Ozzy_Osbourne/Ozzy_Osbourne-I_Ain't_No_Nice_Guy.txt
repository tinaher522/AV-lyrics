<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="I_Ain't_No_Nice_Guy">
When I was young I was the nicest guy I knew
I thought I was the chosen one
But time went by and I found out a thing or two
My shine wore off as time wore on
I thought that I was living out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours when the truth begins to bite
I though about the times when I turned my back and stalled
I ain't no nice guy after all
When I was young I was the only game in town
I thought I had it down for sure
But time went by and I was lost in what I'd found
The reasons blurred the way unsure
I thought that I was living life the only way 
But as I saw that life was more than day to day
I turned around, I read the writing on the wall
I ain't no nice guy after all, 
I ain't no nice guy after all
In all the years you spent between your birth and death
You know there's lots of times when you should have saved your breath
It comes as quite a shock when your trip leads to a wall
I ain't no nice guy after all, 
I ain't no nice guy after all
Hey Slasher?
When I was young I was the nicest guy I knew
I thought I was the chosen one
But time went by and I found out a thing or two 
My shine wore off as time wore on
I thought that I was living out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours when the moons the only light 
I thought about the times when I turned my back and 
stalled
I ain't no nice guy after all, 
I ain't no nice guy after all
