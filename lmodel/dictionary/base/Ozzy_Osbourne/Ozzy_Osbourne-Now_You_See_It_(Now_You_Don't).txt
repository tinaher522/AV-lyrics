<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Now_You_See_It_(Now_You_Don't)">
Overbearing woman
Making it so hard for me
Now you've laid it down for all to see, yeah
Can I ask a question?
D'ya think you can take a blow?
This is why I always come and go, yeah
Now you see it, now you don't, yeah
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man, yeah
Givin' it to me any way that you can, yeah
Everybody's feeling
Everything you've got to feel
I've got something that you can conceal, yeah
Now you see it, now you don't, yeah
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man, yeah
Givin' it to me any way that you can
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Give me central heating
Hope that I can pay the bill
Making me forget my fear of hell, yeah
Must be luck in odd numbers
Now you face me upside down
I'm so far up, I'm afraid to come back down, yeah
Now you see it, now you don't, yeah
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man, yeah
Givin' it to me any way that you can
