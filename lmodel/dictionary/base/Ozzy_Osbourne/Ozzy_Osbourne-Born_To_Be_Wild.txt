All right, the opportunity I've been waiting for all my life!
(Ahhh... the frog can wait...)
Come on babe get in here!
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure
In whatever comes our way
(Oh that's beautiful)
Yeah darling gonna make it happen
(Ah ha!)
Take the world in a love embrace
(Oh yes)
Fire all of your guns at once, and explode into space
I like smoke and lightning
(Ooh I do too!)
Heavy metal thunder
Racin' with the wind
And the feelin' that I'm under
(Oh that's so sweet!)
Yeah darlin' gonna make it happen
(Ah ha)
Take the world in a love embrace
(Oh ozzy)
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
(Awwwww)
Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
(Yes, yes.............. so high!)
We can climb so high
(Go, yes, oh ozzy yes!)
I never wanna die
Born to be wild (together)
Born to be wild (together)
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
(Oh, I love the way you move!)
I wanna see you go wild, mrs. piggy come on!
(Oh oh!)
Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
(Oh this is so beautiful)
We can climb so high
(Yes, yes, yes!)
I never wanna die
Yeah!
Born to be wild (together)
Born to be wild (together)
Hey, born to be wild
