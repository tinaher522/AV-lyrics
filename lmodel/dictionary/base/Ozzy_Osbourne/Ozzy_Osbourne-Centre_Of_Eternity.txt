<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Centre_Of_Eternity">
There's no future, there's no present
I don't even know about the past
It's all timeless and never ending
To take it in is all too vast
It goes (forever and ever)
You thought (you knew but you never)
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
The time is coming but also going
And it's leaving never to return
Maybe heaven could be forever
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn
It goes (forever and ever)
You thought (you knew but you never)
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
I got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavor
But forever is a long, long time
There's no secrets and no corruption
In the centre of infinity
There's no limits in nonexistence
And no beginning to my destiny
It goes (forever and ever)
You thought (you knew but you never)
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
