<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Purple_Haze">
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery
What ever it is that girl put a spell on me
Help me help me
Oh I don't know
Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You've got me blowin, blowin my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time
Who knows?
Help me
Oh yeah
Come on know
Help me
Help me
