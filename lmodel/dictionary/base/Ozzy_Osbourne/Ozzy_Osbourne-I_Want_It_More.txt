<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="I_Want_It_More">
Life is not eternal,
It's sane and then a freak show,
It's all we have until it's all gone 
A split second can last forever,
No fortune can make it better,
One heartbeat just until the last one 
Rung by rung on the ladder,
Don't slow down, only faster,
Knock yourself out; doesn't matter,
Anything to get what you want
How much can you get now?
What's the cost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted,
Everything you wanted?
How much is enough now?
What was lost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted?
Everything you want, I want it more
I want it more
Our destiny connected,
Invited, unexpected,
Life isn't fair, but still it goes on
We all live and we all die,
Say hello then say goodbye,
The sun will set until the next dawn
Inch by inch over old bones,
Shaking hands with the dead souls,
You make your deal and the weight grows,
Anything to get what you want
How much can you get now?
What's the cost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted,
Everything you wanted?
How much is enough now?
What was lost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted?
Everything you want, I want it more
(Guitar Solo)
Rung by rung on the ladder,
Don't slow down, only faster,
Knock yourself out; doesn't matter,
Anything to get what you want
How much can you get now?
What's the cost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted,
Everything you wanted?
How much is enough now?
What was lost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted?
Everything you want, I want it more
