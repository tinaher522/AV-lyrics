<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Slow_Down">
I'll never bother keeping up with you
Burning the candle at both ends, it's true
You know the writing's on the wall
Why do you ride to take a fall?
Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race, yeah
I tried to tell you time and time again
You know you'll have to pay the consequence
Now you're obsessed with such a pace
Now slow and steady wins the race
Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race, yeah
You seem to turn around and round in vain
People are saying that you've gone insane
Tell me just what you're running from
One day you're here, the next you're gone
Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race
Race
Race
Race
Race
