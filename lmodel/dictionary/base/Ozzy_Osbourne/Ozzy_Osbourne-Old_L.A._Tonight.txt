<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Old_L.A._Tonight">
Look into the future
Look into my eyes and tell me
Everything's all right
Tell me where we're going
I'm so afraid 'cause I don't know
What's going on with my life
But it'll be all right tonight
Will it be all right tonight?
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?
Sitting by the ocean
Mapping out my plans of action
Baby, they include you
I wish you'd send a message
Maybe I'm just better off
Not knowing who knew
But it'll be all right tonight (tonight)
I'm gonna be all right tonight
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Who could imagine such a thing could happen to you?
It's gonna be all right in old L.A. tonight
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Who could imagine such a thing could happen to you?
It's gonna be all right in old L.A. tonight
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
It's gonna be all right in old L.A. tonight
