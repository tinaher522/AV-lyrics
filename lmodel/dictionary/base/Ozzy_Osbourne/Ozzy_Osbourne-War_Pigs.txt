[Original Lyrics]
Witches gather at black masses
Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill the church in ruin
Is the scene of evil doings
It's a place for all black sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' inners
I guess it's the same
Where ever you may go
Oh, lord yeah
Carrying banners which denounce the Lord
See me rocking in my grave
See them annoint my head with their black blood
See them stick the stake through me
Don't hold me back cause I just gotta go
Satan's got a hold on my soul now
Look in my brain and there was blood and seed
Look in my eyes in there I know
Yeah
On the scene a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan sends out funeral pyres
Casts the priest into the fire
It's the place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' inners
I guess it's the same
Where ever you may go
Oh, lord yeah
[Official Lyrics]
Generals gathered in their masses!
Just like witches at black masses!
Evil minds that plot destruction!
Sorceror of death's construction!
In the fields are bodies burning!
As the War Machine keeps turning!
Death and hatred to mankind!
Poisoning their brainwashed minds!
Oh Lord, yeah!
Polititians hide themselves away!
They only started the war!
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave their role to the poor!
Yeah!
Time will tell on their Power Minds!
Making war just for fun!
Treating people just like Pawns in Chess!
Wait 'till their Judgement Day comes!
Yeah!
Now in dark, this world stops turning!
Ashes were their bodies burning!
No more War Pigs have the Power!
Hand of God has struck The Hour!
Day of Judgement, God is calling!
On their knees are War Pigs crawling!
Begging mercy for their sins!
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings!
Oh Lord, yeah!
