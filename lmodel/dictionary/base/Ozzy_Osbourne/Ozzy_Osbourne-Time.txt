<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Time">

The time has come for you to make up your own mind
Stop looking for the answers that you'll never find
Save all your tears for when you really need to cry
Don't wish your life away just spread your wings and fly
Time waits for no one, yeah
It's never what it seems
Stop waiting for tomorrow
Stop living in your dreams, yeah
This life, fading away
This life, ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
And I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find time
Can't hide the clock when every line shows on your face
So take it slow you'll never win the human race
Time waits for no one, yeah
Everything must change
Stop running to the future
Start living for today, yeah
This life, fading away
This life, ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
And I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find time
(guitar solo)
Just live every moment of each day
'Cause death is the price we all must pay
This life, fading away
This life, ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
And I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find time
This life, fading away
This life, ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
And I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find time
