Therapy therapy
Lost sight 
I think I'm getting out of my range
Colors flash
Now things are starting to get strange
Start it up
And you say you wanna get it on me, I need I need I nned my
Therapy
Now just relax we'll put your mind at ease
Therapy
But first you've got to say "pretty please"
Therapy therapy
Fire it up
Put a little gas on the brain
All aboard
A ride on the newest thang
Chew chew
Looked out it's a runaway train, pure rain, no gain, insane
It's
Therapy therapy
And right before they dig into my mind
Therapy therapy
The doctor screams "Let's go it's party time"
Therapy therapy
Let right left right
Like every heartbeat needs a motion
Let right left right
Like every wave needs a sea
Let right left right
Like every teardrop needs a eyeball
Let right left right
You've got to name your therapy
Therapy! Therapy! Therapy!
Therapy therapy
Snap pop
A sweet emotion just broke loose
Don't care
It ain't nothing I can use
Ha! Ha!
Ain't it funny how we all abuse you choose, abuse, you lose now
Therapy
You know we want to help we really care
Therapy
But when your money's gone you're out of here!
