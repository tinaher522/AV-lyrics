Fuck that shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm a give a shout out to my nigga
I ain't givin' a shout out to no-fuckin-body, fuck that
Big Baby Jesus in the muthafuckin' house
Know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck it
Come on
I don't walk, I stalk, livin' fat like pork
Shuttin' down underground streets of New York
Hawk is what them niggas call me, 'cause they all be
Suckin' my dick and on my mother fucking balls, G
I know the half, so I laugh wit' 'em
Bloodbath, when I let the fuckin' rap hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em
That's all it took, another crook
Taken out over a dirty look
[I bag game with niggas I leave shot dead]?
You ain't takin' a fuckin' thing from me but hot lead
You know my style faggot, 'cause I'm always schemin'
In jail, niggas is holdin' a sink screamin'
Police, but you got no peace
Yo, was that you big man, and alot mo' grease
All I gets is pounds, niggas wants none of this
Back streets are like track meets 'cause I be runnin' this
[Chorus:]
Ain't nowhere to run ('cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)
Ain't nowhere to go ('cause I be runnin' this)
Reaper saved your soul (come on)
Surronded by the colors, I see crimson, black and blue (come on)
Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you (straight up, mother fucker)
Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew (come on)
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do? (straight up)
Sister of the universe, selecting me in time (come on)
I'm falling down upon the earth, and singing truth in rhyme (come on)
If I was a rolling stone, I'd roll until I'm blue (come on)
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you (dirt dog inna fuckin' house)
[Chorus]
Ahhhh, yi yi yi yi (come on)
[Chorus]
Aaaaaaaaah
What you mother fuckers invented
Is the craziest nigga ever been invented
Ha ha ha ha ha
Most know, don't front on ol' Dirty Bastard
Ha ha ha ha
I call on Jesus!
There's no obstacles that you have to jump
There's no walls that you have to climb
This is real, this is elementary dear
Elementary, watson, elementary
Ahhhhh
I ain't no picture on your fuckin' wall, necklace wearin' bitch
Nigga, I want this money till it's rich
Buy my album, coded by dirty, set you free
Go against the grain, I got to pee
I know you don't recognize me now
I done cocooned
How many lightning bugs do it take to light up the fuckin' moon?
Government people, you better get the fuck up off of me
We don't need it!
It gets more ugly
Bitches be tryin' to bust their ass
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name
I call myself: In-the-bitch-butthole
All the same, all the same, all the same
Nigga
Ain't nowhere to run
Ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go
Reaper saved your soul
Ahhh yi yi yi yi
What, mother fucker?
Don't try to psychology my shit, mother fucker
'cause you'll never psychology it, mother fucker
Never, never, never, mother fucker, never
