<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="You_Know...">
Tried to be your father
Things just made it harder
Sorry if I made you cry
Years turned you against me
Heart was always aching
And I never thought you'd say goodbye
I could have been wrong
You know
I should have been strong
You know
That'll do
Ha ha ha
