<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="You're_No_Different">
How many times can you put me down
Till in your heart you realize
If you choose to criticize
You choose your enemies
Everything that I say and do
In your eyes is always wrong
Tell me where do I belong
In a sick society
You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
Look at yourself instead of looking at me
With accusation in your eyes
Do you want me crucified
For my profanity
Concealing your crimes behind a grandeur of lies
Tell me where do I begin
If you think you're without sin
Be the first to cast the stone
You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
Can't you see, can't you see
You're no different to me
Won't you see, won't you see
You're no different to me
Living my life in a way that I choose
You say I should apologize
Is that envy in your eyes
Reflecting jealousy
Tell me the truth and I'll admit to my guilt
If you'll try to understand
But is that blood that's on your hand
From your democracy
You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
