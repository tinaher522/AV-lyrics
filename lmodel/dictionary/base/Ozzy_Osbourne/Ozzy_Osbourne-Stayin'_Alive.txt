<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Stayin'_Alive">
All aboard the disco train ha ha ha
All right now
Oh yeah
Well you can tell by the way I move and
Walk I'm a women's man no time to talk
Music loud and women warm,
I've been kicked around since I was born.
It's all right, it's okay,
You may look the other way.
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man.
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.
Everybody on the dance floor darling
We're going to dance with the devil
Well, now I get low and I get high,
And if I can't get either, I really try.
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes,
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.
You know, it's all right, it's okay,
I'll live to see another day.
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man.
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.
It's all right, it's okay,
You may look the other way.
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man.
It's all right, I'ts okay,
You may live to see another day.
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man.
Ha ha ha ha
I am disco man
O yeah, all right now
I, I, I, I
Im back ha ha ha
