<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Rock_'N'_Roll_Rebel">
They couldn't see what I thought would be so obvious
They hide behind the laws they make for all of us
The ministry of truth that deals with pretense
The ministry of peace that sits on defense
I'm washing my hands of what they're trying to do
It's a me, It's a me, It's a you, It's a you
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the devil
They must be stupid or blind
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel
They live a life of fear and insecurity
And all you do is pay for their prosperity
The ministry of fear that won't let you live
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive
Do what you will to try and make me conform
I'll make you wish that you had never been born
'Cause I'm a rock n' roll rebel
I'll do what I please
Yes I'm a rock n' roll rebel
And I'm as free as the breeze
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel
They'll try playin' with your hearts
They know it rules your head
If they could read between the lines
You know they'd see the real face
God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious
Is it because they manifest the incubus?
The ministry of war that got caught in the draft
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When it's boiled down and the day's at an end
I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend
'Cause I'm a rock n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the devil
Why don't they open their eyes?
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel
A rock n' roll rebel
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel
