<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Black_Rain">
The black rain is falling
Contaminating the ground
The human race is dying
The dead are scattered around
What is the price of a bullet?
Another hole in the head
A flag draped over a coffin
Another soldier is dead
How many victims have fallen?
How many more have to die?
People dying in masses
Angel of death standing by
We've got our marching orders
Defenders of our home and our pride
We've crossed through many borders
In-between suicides
War, killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack
There is no turning back
Blood, running down like water
You think you've got away
Until the judgment day comes
Politicians confuse me
I watch the body count rise
Why are the children all marching
Into the desert to die
The human psyche is twisted
The madness rising again
Another hit by a bullet
I watch them dying in vain
We've got our marching orders
Defenders of our home and our pride
We've crossed through many borders
In-between suicides
War, send our sons to slaughter
Another failed attack
There is no turning back
Blood, running down like water
You think you got away
Until the judgment day comes
War, killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack
There is no turning back
Blood, running down like water
You think you've got away
Until the judgment day
You think you've got away
Until your judgment day comes
