<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Latimer's_Mercy">
Another day, another full seizure,
Another pill, you spiral down deeper,
Another cut by a surgical butcher,
It's just the way of prolonging the torture
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing,
I won't say that I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)
I'll turn off the lights,
And swallow your last breath (last breath),
So close your eyes, fall asleep (close your eyes)
I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)
The sun shines on this deadly new morning,
The church bells ring an early warning,
Your eyes shine as I turn on the motor,
The tears fall as the mercy gets closer
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing,
I won't say that I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)
I'll turn off the lights,
And swallow your last breath (last breath),
So close your eyes, fall asleep (close your eyes)
I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)
(Guitar Solo)
I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)
I'll turn off the lights,
And swallow your last breath (last breath),
So close your eyes, fall asleep (close your eyes)
I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)
