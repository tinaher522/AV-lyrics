<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="My_Jekyll_Doesn't_Hide">
Condemned to violence, arrested by pain
Inside the soul lies a man insane
Conceived in anger, addict to hate
The mutant child of a twisted state
Beware the contradiction
Beneath the crimson void
'Cause in the world of fiction
My Jekyll doesn't hide
A killer's smile with a psycho star dream
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem
Unholy soldier, disciple of sin
What kind of mind are you living in?
You're preaching revolution
Don't you mean genocide?
Behind this resolution
My Jekyll doesn't hide
Waiting to die for the very first time
All right, that's right
Waiting to die for the very first time
All right, that's right
Waiting to die for the very first time
I don't give a damn
'Cause I think it's my time, my time
Ah
The symbiosis of murder and lies
What do I see looking through your disguise?
Fourth Reich dementia, subversion ideals
God only knows what your secret conceals
Who'll be the first offender?
Who will be victimized?
In your perverse agenda
My Jekyll doesn't hide
