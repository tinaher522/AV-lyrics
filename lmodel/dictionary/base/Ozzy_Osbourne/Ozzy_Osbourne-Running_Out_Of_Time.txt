<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Running_Out_Of_Time">
Been around this world so many times
If you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell
Faith alone has guided me
The ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell
All the things I put me through
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
You'll never know whats going on inside
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
Trouble always seems to find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted hell and me remain alone
Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I tried to find a light to guide me home
Mama please, just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
'Cause you're the only one that really knows
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
Fighting for my sanity
Many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my wretched ways behind
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
