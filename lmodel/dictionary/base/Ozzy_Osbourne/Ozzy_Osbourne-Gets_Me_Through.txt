<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Gets_Me_Through">
I'm not the kind of person
You think I am
I'm not the antichrist or
The Iron Man
I have a vision that I
Just can't control
I feel I've lost my spirit
And sold my soul
Got no control
I try to entertain you
The best I can
I wished I started walking
Before I ran
But I still love the feeling
I get from you
I hope you'll never stop cause
It gets me through, yeah
It gets me through, yeah
The feelings that I hide behind
Sometime reality's unkind
The nightmares start for me at night
I dread the long and lonely nights
I'm not the kind of person
You think I am
I'm not the antichrist or
The Iron Man
But I still love the feeling
I get from you
I hope you'll never stop, 'cause
It gets me through, yeah
I'm just trying to live, yeah
I'm just trying to live, yeah
I'm just trying to live, yeah
