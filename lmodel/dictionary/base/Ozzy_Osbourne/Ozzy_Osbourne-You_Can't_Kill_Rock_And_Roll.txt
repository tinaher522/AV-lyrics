<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="You_Can't_Kill_Rock_And_Roll">
How many times can they fill me with lies
And I listen again
Twisting the truth and they're playin' around
With my head, okay
The things they will do and the things they will say
But they don't really understand
Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries
For the reason today
And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock 'n' roll is my religion and my law
It won't ever change
You may think it's strange
You can't kill rock'n'roll
It's here to stay, yeah
Looking through eyes of time
Mirrors reflecting their stories untrue
Promises promises
Telling me all of my glories overdue
How many times have I heard it before
And I'll probably hear it again
King of a thousand knights
Pawn in a table fight losing to you
And they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock 'n' roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock 'n' roll
It's here to stay
Even the rhymes that they give me
In times of confession ain't true
Outcome is obvious
All for them none for us meaning you too
The things they will do and the things they will say
When they don't really understand
Fear of rejection, I need their protection
I'm making a stand
'Cause they don't really know
Even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock 'n' roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change
May think it's strange
You can't kill rock 'n' roll it's here to stay
Leave me alone
Don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock 'n' roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change
May think it's strange
I'm born to rock 'n' roll, 
I'm here to stay, yeah
