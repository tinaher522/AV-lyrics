<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Go_Now">
We've already said goodbye
Since you gotta go, oh you better
Go now, go now, go now, go now
Go, before you see me cry
I don't want you to tell me
Just what you intend to do now
'Cause how many times do I have to tell you, darling
I'm still in love with you now, whoa
We've already said so long
I don't wanna see you go, oh you better
Go now, go now, go now, go now
Go, don't you even try
Tellin' me that you don't want me to end up
This way, way
'Cause darling darling
Can't you see I want you to stay, stay
We've already said goodbye
Since you gotta go, oh you better
Go now, go now, go now, go now
Go, go
I don't want you to tell me
Just what you intend to do now
'Cause how many times do I have to tell you, darling
I'm still in love, I'm still in love with you now
I don't wanna see you go but darling
You better go now
