<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Iron_Head">
What is the purpose
Demonoid phenomenon
Regulate the flux and reflux
So bring it on
Loose upon the world
Destruct a juggernaut
Suddenly the rats are high
Bleed the masses and watch'em cry
Slumber like Houdini's dog
Die alone out in the fog
Iron head- regenerate
Iron head-exterminate
Iron head-liberate and crucify you
What is my name
Demonoid phenomenon
Laugh in your face and
Break because you don't belong
Vent upon the brink
Appear another demi-god
Suddenly forever knows
What it takes and where it goes
Paint it black inside your head
I defy what you have said
