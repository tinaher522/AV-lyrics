<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="For_What_It's_Worth">
Something's happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong
People speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind
Yeah, stop children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, look, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
What a field-day for the heat
Ten thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side"
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, look, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man coming to take you away
You gotta stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going
You better stop
Stop
I think it's time we stop
Stop
You better stop
