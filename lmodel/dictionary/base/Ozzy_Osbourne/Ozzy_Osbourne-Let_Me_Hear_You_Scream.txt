<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Let_Me_Hear_You_Scream">
Let me hear you scream
I'm black and bruised, beat up
But still I take the blows
'Cause all I need is blood and sweat
And skin and bones
I'll take this rage, rattle your cage
Nobody said it's easy
It's do or die, only the strong survive
Get ready for the last stand
Get ready, I'm your hangman
Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're gonna go down, go loud, go strong, go proud
Go on, go hard or go home
Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream
I'll pull you up and push you right
Back in your place
I'll take you down and wipe that smile
Right off your face
I'll watch you break, you're mine to take
Don't blink, you just might miss it
It's all or nothing, nowhere left to run
Are you ready for the last fight?
Get ready with the war cry
Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're gonna go down, go loud, go strong, go proud
Go on, go hard or go home
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream!
Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're gonna go down, go loud, go strong, go proud
Go on, go hard or go home
Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're gonna go down, go loud, go strong, go proud
Go on, go hard or go home
Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream
