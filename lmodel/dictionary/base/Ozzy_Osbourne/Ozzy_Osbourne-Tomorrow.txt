<song artist="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="Tomorrow">
Have you read the message
The writing on the wall?
Could it be the answer
The answer to it all?
What's going down in Heaven?
I'm playing with your head
Don't believe them when they tell you
You'd be better off dead
Living in a thunder
Driving me insane
Can I get a witness
To take away the pain?
Walking on the water
Going nowhere fast
Feeling like I'm walking
With no shoes on broken glass
You know it
You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind
No more goodbyes or yesterdays, so it's
I'll see you tomorrow
I'll see you tomorrow
Welcome to the sideshow
I'll cut it to the chase
Yeah I can hear you thinking
It's going all to waste
I don't mean to offend you
When I look you in the eyes
What's all this commotion?
It leaves me mystified
Chasing all the rainbows
Falling from the sky
I know your intentions
Are all a bunch of lies
I'm running out of patience
Falling off track
You better start to worry
'Cause I may not make it back
All right now
You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind
One good reason to blow me away, so it's
I'll see you tomorrow
I'll see you tomorrow
(Can't wait till tomorrow
Tomorrow comes
I never killed anybody
It was a Gun!  Hahahahaha!)
Living in the big house
Dying by the rail
If I wanted your opinion
I'd call you up in hell
Could this be the mailman
Knockin' on the door
Or just another lightweight
Finally evening the score
You know it
You don't have to leave the lights on
I'm so used to being blind
No more goodbyes or yesterdays, so it's
I'll see you tomorrow
No more reasons to blow you away
So it's
I'll see you tomorrow
