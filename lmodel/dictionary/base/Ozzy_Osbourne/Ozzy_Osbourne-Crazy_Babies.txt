Crazy babies
Crazy babies never say die
Born to live on a permanent high
Flying high above the world below
They'd better come down soon, or everyone will know, that's right
Nobody's gonna change them, change them
They've gone over the top
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them
They're never gonna stop
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Crazy babies
When they were born, they were born to be wild
Some say I'm another Devil's child
Crazy babies in a world of their own
I am a crazy baby, better leave me alone tonight
Nobody's gonna change me, change me
I'm gonna do it 'til I die
Nobody's gonna tame me, tame me
So you'd better not try
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Crazy babies
No use talking 'bout if they'll last
Where they're goin' or about their past
They're just the result of our society
So frustrated, just like you and me, that's right
Nobody's gonna change them, change them
They've gone over the top
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them
They're never gonna stop
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Walk that walk
Talk that - Talk
