[Pixie]
Hmm Jason DeRulo
[Jason]
Oh Pixie
[Pixie]
Oh no usually I'm always late
Tonight I'm gonna be on time
[Both]
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
[Pixie]
You say where are you going?
In the night I'm awake
'Cos my body's not to close to you
But you don't call me,
Out of respect you can bet that you'll be waiting home for me yeah
[Both]
I'm out for the whole day
Try'na do it my way
Monday to Friday
Gotta make my baby understand
I do this for you boy, 'cos you deserve the time
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell
All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself
[Pixie]
I'm coming home...
[Jason]
You're always complaining
In the morn' when I wake from my sleep
Brush my teeth and leave
And now that I'm famous
It's kinda hard making time for the one that means most to me yeah
I'm out for the whole day
Try'na do it my way
Monday to Friday
Gotta make my baby understand
I do it for you girl
'Cos you deserve the time
[Both]
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell
All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself
[Jason]
When i'm away I miss my baby
[Pixie]
Yeah i'm gone with half my heart
[Jason]
God knows I must be crazy
[Pixie]
For loving from afar
[Jason]
But tonight it's gonna be different
[Both]
'Cos i'm coming home
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell
All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me all to yourself
We'll be alone just me and you
Where no one interrupts what we do
I'm coming home straight after work
So you can have me under your spell
All night, all day
So you can have me all to yourself
Have me all to yourself, all to youself
