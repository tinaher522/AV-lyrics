<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Mama_Do_(Uh_Oh,_Uh_Oh)">
Uh Oh, Uh Oh
Every night I go, Every night I go sneakin' out the door
I lie a little more
Baby I'ma helpless
There's something 'bout the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me
What would my Mama Do
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If she knew 'bout me and you
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
What would my daddy say
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If he saw me hurt this way
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
Here we are again
It's nearly perfect
What would my Mama Do
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If she knew 'bout me and you
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
What would my daddy say
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If he saw me hurt this way
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
Ooooooh
What would my Mama Do?
Ooooooh
What would my daddy say?
All the things a girl should know
All the things she can't control
All the things a girl should know
She can't control
What would my Mama Do
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If she knew 'bout me and you
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
What would my daddy say
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
If he saw me hurt this way
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
(Uh Oh, Uh Oh)
