<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Kiss_The_Stars">
Uuuh oooh uuuh oooh
Baby, baby, we're on the rocket
Venus and Mars now, can't be apart now.
 Baby, baby, put me in your pocket 
We're on a mission, get in position. 
Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
 When you turn it on I can go for hours,
Hit the switch push the button, baby then you'll see
 We can have it all, baby you and me.  
Kiss the stars tonight
You and me
Oh we will write our name in lights 
Then we'll see
 We're in love tonight
Love tonight
We're in love tonight. 
Love tonight
Love tonight
We're in love tonight.
(We're on the rocket)
 Baby, baby we're on the rocket
Wherever we land you'll be my spaceman.
 Baby, baby we're supersonic
Now we're together, we'll last forever. 
Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
 When you turn it on I can go for hours,
Hit the switch push the button, baby then you'll see
 We can have it all, baby you and me.  
  Kiss the stars tonight
You and me
Oh we will write our name in lights 
Then we'll see
 We're in love tonight
Love tonight
We're in love tonight. 
Love tonight
Love tonight
We're in love tonight.
Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
 When you turn it on I can go for hours,
Hit the switch push the button, baby then you'll see
 We can have it all, baby you and me
 We-we-we can have it all, baby you and me
 We-we-we can have it all, baby you and me.
Kiss the stars tonight
You and me
Oh we will write our name in lights 
Then we'll see
 We're in love tonight
Love tonight
We're in love tonight. 
Love tonight
Love tonight
We're in love tonight.
(We're on the rocket, we-we're on the rocket)
