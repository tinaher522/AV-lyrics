<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Caravan_Of_Love">
Are you ready for the time of your life?
It's time to stand up and fight
Hand in hand, we'll take a caravan to the motherland 
One by one, we're gonna stand up with pride
One that can't be denied
Now the children of the world can see
There's a better place for us to be
The place in which we were born, so neglected and torn apart
Every woman, every man, join the caravan of love
Stand up
Everybody take a stand, join the caravan of love
Stand up
He's my brother, he's my brother, don't you know?
I'm your sister, I'm your sister, don't you know?
We'll be living in a world of peace
And the day when everyone is free
Will bring the young and the old
Won't you let your love flow from your heart
Every woman, every man, join the caravan of love
Stand up
Everybody take a stand, join the caravan of love
Stand up
He's my brother, he's my brother, don't you know?
I'm your sister, I'm your sister, don't you know?
Every woman, every man, join the caravan of love
Stand up
