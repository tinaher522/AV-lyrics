<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Bang">
Kiss me, you're gonna miss me
'Cause by tomorrow, it will all be gone
Guns are shooting, people looting
Sirens blaring, the world is done
Look deep into my eyes and say
No matter what, we will be safe
Oh what the hell, I'm just gonna tell you I love you
Won't you lie with me
As the world falls asleep
In your arms I'm at peace
The lights fade away
On our last day
At least we can say
We went out with a bang, bang, bang
Yeah we're all goners, just being honest
Nowhere to run now, we're at the end
Bring your lips closer, before it's over
Give me a memory, to take to heaven
Look deep into my eyes and say
No matter what, we will be safe
Oh what the hell, I'm just gonna tell you I love you
Won't you lie with me
As the world falls asleep
In your arms I'm at peace
The lights fade away
On our last day
At least we can say
We went out with a bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
It's the final hour
And I'm so glad to spend it with you
Won't you lie with me
As the world falls asleep
In your arms I'm at peace
The lights fade away
On our last day
At least we can say
We went out with a bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Won't you lie with me
As the world falls asleep
In your arms I'm at peace
The lights fade away
On our last day
At least we can say
We went out with a bang
