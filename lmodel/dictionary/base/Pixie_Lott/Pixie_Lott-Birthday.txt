<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Birthday">
(Verse 1)
oh, oh, oh, oh,
Felt like I was having one of them days,
When nothing goes right, so I drift away,
Stuck with my back up against the wall,
Didn't know it was you I was waiting for,
Close to tears I was stressing out,
With you I forgot what I worry about,
Took your time but at least you're here,
And all the drama's disappeared,
Oh, you saved my life you saved my life,
(Chorus)
It started out as the worst day,
But now you got me feeling like it's my birthday,
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
Caught in the rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
(Verse 2)
Don't need to party or Bacardi and Coke or cake,
I get exited when I know that I see your face,
We can stay home cause it's just as fun,
An invitation you can be my plus one,
Now I know there's nothing that I can't do,
I'm pretty sure that it's something to do with you,
Took your time but at least you're here,
And all the drama's disappeared,
Oh, you saved my life you saved my life,
(Chorus)

It started out as the worst day,
But now you got me feeling like it's my birthday,
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
Caught in the rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
(Hook)
You pick me up when I'm down and you turn it all around,
I just can't get enough,
My feet don't touch the ground,
I just can't get enough,
When you're holding me tight it'll all be alright,
It's like it's my f*ing birthday,
(instrumental)
(Chorus)
It started out as the worst day,
But now you got me feeling like it's my birthday,
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
Caught in rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday) (x2)
Caught in the rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
