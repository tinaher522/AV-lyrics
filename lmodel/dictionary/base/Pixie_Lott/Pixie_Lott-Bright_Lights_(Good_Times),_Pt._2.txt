<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Bright_Lights_(Good_Times),_Pt._2">
Yeah step steadily deal with reality
Then wonder why we feel so cold diddly?
Singing from the heart but not one of them was hearing me
Left us in the back drown ? harmony
? no I'm clean take a look at me
Wasn't over night nope never happen suddenly
Finally I think I see bright lights dazzle me
Kill to the games heart beat crime felony
Now it's a new day ?
?
London night life
They say money can't buy time
Watch cost the whole case
You ain't got to rewind time
Feels like my clocks run out
I can only see when I'm looking down
Trying to find a way to get out of this guillotine
I can't go through another day
Wishing my whole life away
I'm starting to lose my faith in reality
This time I had enough
I'm putting my hand up
I hate the way I feeling lost
And my way succeed
Everybody's hustling
Trying to find where I fit in
But I know, yeah I know the end is where it begins
'Cause flash lights and good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright light in the sky light won't let me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow something's gotta change
So close but it's still so far
I figured out whats in my heart
I took a step out of the dark
Now I'm on my way
Moving on to better things
Cutting off my puppet strings
To unleash my readied wings
And fly away, yeah
This time I've had enough
I'm putting my hands up
Never gonna be feeling lost
In my uncertainty?
There comes a time we all fall down
?
But I know, yeah I know the end is where it begins
'Cause flash lights and good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright light in the sky light won't let me lose my way
Cause I know somehow something's gotta change
Yeah
Oh oh it's going be alright
Oh oh not gonna sleep tonight
Oh oh until we see the lights that bring us hope
Oh oh it's gonna be alright
Oh oh we're gonna touch the sky
Oh oh I know the city lights will guide us home
Flash lights and good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright light in the sky light won't let me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow something's gotta change
Oh oh it's going be alright
Oh oh not gonna sleep tonight
Oh oh until we see the lights that bring us hope
Oh oh it's gonna be alright
Oh oh we're gonna touch the sky
Oh oh oh somethings gotta change
Oh oh oh
