<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Poker_Face">
I wanna hold 'em like
They do in Texas , please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me
Raise it, baby, stay with me
Love game intuition play
The cards with space to start
And after he's been hooked
I'll play the one that's on his heart
Ohh, ohh, oh, e, ohh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got
Oh, ohh I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She is got to love nobody
Po-po-po-poker face
Po-po-poker face
Po-po-po-poker face
Po-po-poker face
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun
When you're with me
Russian Roulette
Is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love
If it's not rough it isn't fun
Can't read my, my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She is got to love nobody
