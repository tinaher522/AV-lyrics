<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Bandaid">
When I met you I didn't really like you
First impression was that you were somebody who'd
Walk right by when I wave at you and say hi
But they say bad beginnings make happy endings
Now that I know you I begin to understands things
Turn around 180 degrees, I found my missing piece
There's something 'bout you that's like the sun
You warm up my heart when I come undone
You're like my soulmate and on those days
When I hurt, when I break, oh, oh
You are my band aid, you are, you are
When I hurt, when I break, you are
You are, you are
When I hurt, when I break, you are
When I get caught in the rain and it feels like
There is no one in the world who understands my
Complications that I face on certain days
I talk it through with you, no matter how I try to hide
You see straight through my disguise
You know how to fix me, you are my therapy, baby
Ooh, there's something 'bout you that's like the sun
You warm up my heart when I come undone
You're like my soulmate and on those days
When I hurt, when I break, oh, oh
You are my band aid, you are, you are
When I hurt, when I break, you are
You are, you are
When I hurt, when I break, you are
Isn't it funny how these things get turn around?
Just when I thought I knew you, you prove me wrong
I used to hate the things you loved and loved the things you hate
But now I like it, I like it, I like it
Now I la, la, la, I like it, I like it, I like it
Now I la, la, la, I like it, I like it, I like it
There's something 'bout you that's like the sun
You warm up my heart when I come undone
You're like my soulmate and on those days
When I hurt, when I break, oh, oh
You are my band aid, you are, you are
When I hurt, when I break, you are
You are, you are
I like it, I like it, I like it
Now I la, la, la, I like it, I like it, I like it
Now I la, la, la, I like it, I like it, I like it
Now I la, la, la, I like it, I like it, I like it
