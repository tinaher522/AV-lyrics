<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="(Your_Love_Keeps_Lifting_Me)_Higher_And_Higher">
Your love lifted me higher 
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, question my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (Your love keeps lifting me)
Higher, higher and higher (Your love keeps lifting me)
I said your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (Your love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me higher and higher
Now once I was down hearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and it soon departed
And you know he never showed his face again
That's why your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (Your love keeps lifting me)
Higher, higher and higher (Your love keeps lifting me)
I said your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (Your love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me higher and higher 
I'm so glad I finally found you
You're a one in a million boy
And now when my loving arms around you
Honey, I can stand up and face the world
Let me tell you, your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (Your love keeps lifting me)
Higher, higher and higher (Your love keeps lifting me)
I said your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (Your love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me higher and higher
Keep lifting me
Take me higher
Come and take me higher
