<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="The_Girl_You_Left_Behind">
It's way too hot to even think in here
A girl could lose her cool
I'm gonna have to get a drink in here
And sit out by the pool
Sip my mojito, checking out the view
Kick off my blood red shoes.
I love to watch the way the water moves
The deepest shade of blue.
But every time I get the chance to reflect,
I know exactly what to expect
My thoughts are gonna turn to you and then
All the questions start again.
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl,
You left behind at all?
Don't see no point in looking back
On the hell you put me through
You always had a way to make my mood
The deepest shade of blue.
But every time I get a chance to relax,
I find my mind just going over the facts
Who you were with, the how, the why and the when
All the questions start again!
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl,
You left behind at all?
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl,
You left behind at all?
'Cause she thinks about you every day
How you hurt her in every possible way
And now you know she's gonna make you pay
So you better look behind! (You better!)
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl,
You left behind at all?
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl?
Do you ever wonder about the girl,
You left behind at all?
