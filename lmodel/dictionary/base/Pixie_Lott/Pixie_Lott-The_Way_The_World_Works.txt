<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="The_Way_The_World_Works">
Gimme just a little break
Ain't no more that I can take
I am asking for the planets to align
Calling on the universe
Maybe once, just put me first
Gimme what I need or give a little sign
Nothing plays out like it should
And nothing does me any good
'Cause I'm missing you, it's making me cry
Ooh, I know it's turning
Inside I'm burning...
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
I don't mind a little pain
But enough's enough
But does the heart grow fonder?
Will I wait here on ya?
Baby, how much longer?
Ooh, I know it's turning
All I am learning is...
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire trying to keep us apart
There's so much in life that's undecided
There's so much touble that's uninvited
And only so much you can control
What are the forces that try to tease us
I wish the forces would just release us
I haven't seen you in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, baby
(Hey, hey, gimme just a little break, hey, hey, ain't no more that I can take, hey, hey)
They're trying to keep us apart
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
