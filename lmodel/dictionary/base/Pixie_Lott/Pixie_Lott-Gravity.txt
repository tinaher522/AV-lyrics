<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Gravity">
Gravity (x6)
Stop pullin’ me
I know that you still haven’t found you,
And when I wanna stand on my own too
Suddenly you start to show
Signs of what is possible
Then you’re back to your ways
And I let me down
Tell me why I keep tryin’a stay around
When all my family
They always telling me
To be through with you
And I know that deep down I’m callin’ time on you
On you
On you
Every time I’m ready to leave
I seem to be
Pullin’ in the wrong direction
Divin’ in with no protection
Man, you can’t keep steerin’ me wrong
Oh gravity
Pullin’ me back
Pullin’ me in
Why you pullin’ me back
Pullin’ me in
Just like gravity
Gravity (x5)
I know I betrayed but I’m made to
Ignore the universe when I see you
Cause every night the stars will shine
Verging into U-turns times
Anythin’ that they can just to change my mind
When I pass your road I can’t help rewind
What is wrong with me?
All that I wanna be is
Through with you
And I know that deep down I’m callin’ time on you
On you
On you
Every time I’m ready to leave
I seem to be
Pullin’ in the wrong direction
Divin’ in with no protection
Man, you can’t keep steerin’ me wrong
Oh gravity
Pullin’ me back
Pullin’ me in
Why you pullin’ me back
Pullin’ me in
Just like gravity
Gravity (x5)
Stop pulling me
Gravity (x5)
Be quiet, let me leave, let me go
Don’t say another word
Cause with every sound
You’re pullin’ me down
Baby,
You got a hold on me
Like gravity
Yeah (x6)
Yeah (x5)
Gravity
Every time I’m ready to leave
I seem to be
Pullin’ in the wrong direction
Divin’ in with no protection
Man, you can’t keep steerin’ me wrong
Oh gravity
Pullin’ me back
Pullin’ me in
Why you pullin’ me back
Pullin’ me in
Just like gravity
Gravity (x5)
Gravity, yeah
Gravity (x6)
