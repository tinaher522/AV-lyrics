<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Leaving_You">
Life is cruel, these circumstances
Why were there chances?
I'd fought so hard for you
The times not right
And we both know it
But you're not to show it
Pulling apart slowly from you
Kissing me so sweetly, a taste of margarita
I won't forget that day
You're the one I dreamed of
Always be my first love
But you know that I can't stay
And I'll never get over
Leaving you, you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Lazy days, spent in the sunshine
Drinking Ros√© wine
Feeling so easy with you
Late night walks, talking together
Hoping forever, wouldn't be coming so soon
Letting go of someone I don't wanna part from
I won't forget today
Everything I dreamed of
So glad that you're my first love
But you know that I can't stay
And I'll never get over
Leaving you, you
But I know it's what I gotta do
No I know that it's over,
Leaving you, you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Maybe some day
Our roads will cross again
Don't say it's the end
Maybe some day, but baby until then
And I'll never get over
Leaving you, you
Is the hardest thing I'll ever do
No, I know that it's over
Leaving you, Leaving you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
I gotta leave you baby
Though it hurts me
And I'll never get over this
And when it hurts, it hurts
It's killing me, it's killing me
