All my friends are going out but I've been thinking
Maybe I better stay in bed
The ceiling's spinning 'round like I've been drinking
I've got this banging in my head
Boom, boom, boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin
I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I'll sleep through the alarm head under pillow
I know I'm gonna pay for this
I can't stand missing out so when you call me, call me
I'll say okay if you insist
Boom, boom, boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin
I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
