<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Raise_Up">
This ain't a fairytale,
There's no way to tip the scales
For each win, I seem to fail
That's the way it goes
Sometimes I ain't that tough
And my best ain't good enough
When I try and shake it off
Still I hit that low
But the more that it hurts me
The more I keep on
I reach down inside me
And I know I'll overcome
If I lose my strength,
If I'm hanging by a thread
If I'm going under,
I raise up
Just like a river flowing,
I bend but never broken
In time, every cloud disappears like smoke
And when my edge is closer
And I'm slowly going over
Those things won't bring me down
When I'm up against the ropes
The more that you stop me
The faster I run
It's never that easy
But I know I'll overcome
If I fall from grace
If I'm feeling out of place
When I'm trying so hard to get there
I raise up
I raise up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I raise up, up, up
I raise up
I raise up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I raise up, up, up
I raise up
Just like a river flowing
I bend but never broken
In time, every cloud disappears like smoke
If I lose my strength,
If I'm hanging by a thread
If I'm going under
I raise up
If I lose my strength,
If I'm hanging by a thread
If I'm going under
I raise up
If I fall from grace
If I'm feeling out of place
When I'm trying so hard to get there
I raise up
I raise up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I raise up, up, up
I raise up
I raise up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I raise up, up, up
I raise up
If I lose my shade
If I'm going under, yeah
I raise up
Well, if I fall from grace
When I'm feeling out of place
Yeah, I raise up
