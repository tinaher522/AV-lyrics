<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Bright_Lights_(Good_Life)_Part_II">
Step steadily deal with reality
They wonder why we feel so cold bitterly
Singing from the heart what is left within me
Left us in a back drowned dry harmony
Done a bit of dirt, now i'm clean, take a look at me
Wasn't overnight, no never happened suddenly
Finally I think I see bright lights dazzle me
Through the games heartbeat crime felony and I am
And now is a new day, they snap snap pics and a lot of them i pose in my new shades
London night life they say money can't buy time watch cost the whole case
You ain't got to rewind time, still got my rough squad, family ties
From the ground to the sky and it wasn't overnight I am cloud nine Strydz
Feels like my clock's run out
Can only see when I'm looking down
Tryna find a way to get out of this guillotine
Can't go through another day
Wishing my whole life away I'm starting to lose my faith in reality
This time I've had enough
I'm putting my hands up
I hate the way I'm feeling lost in my own suceed
Everybody's hustling
Tryna find where I fit in
But I know, yeah I know the end is where it begins
'Cause the flash lights and the good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow
Something's gonna change
Bright lights and the sky light
Won't make me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow Something's gonna change
So close yet still so far
I figured out what's in my heart
I took a step out of the dark
Now I'm on my way
Moving on to better things
Cutting off my puppet strings
To unleash my ready wings
And fly away
This time I've had enough I'm putting my hands up
Never gonna be feeling lost in my own succeed
There comes a time when we all fall down
And get knocked by London Town
But I know, yeah I know that this is where it begins
'Cause the flash lights and the good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow
Something's gonna change
Bright lights and the sky light
Won't make me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow
Something's gonna change
Oh oh, it's gonna be alright
Oh oh, not gonna sleep tonight
Oh oh, until we see the light
That brings us home
Oh oh,it's gonna be alright
Oh oh, we're gonna touch the sky
Oh oh, another city light Will guide us home
'Cause the flash lights and the good life
Keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow
Something's gonna change
Bright lights and the sky light
Won't make me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow Something's gonna change
Oh oh, it's gonna be alright
Oh oh, we're gonna sleep tonight
Oh oh, until we see the light
That brings us home
Oh oh,it's gonna be alright
Oh oh, we're gonna touch the sky
Oh oh, somethings gonna change
