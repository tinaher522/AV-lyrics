<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Cry_And_Smile">
Gonna sun into forever.
Gonna lie, soul dust together.
Goodbye friend, bye bye birdy kisses.
It can't be the end, can't we go back again.
It was all so easy then.
I cry and smile, 'cause your looking down here with your heart of gold.
And in the silence, your'll be resting your soul.
Heaven knows I try to hold back the river, 
but these tears I cry wont bring you home.
When I knock three times, no-body answers.
No more apple bags, to cook on the stove.
I guess all good things must end,
I cry and smile, 'cause your looking down here with your heart of gold.
And in the silence, your'll be resting your soul.
So I lost you in the dark, but I lock you in my heart.
I promise, here I keep you until I meet you again.
I cry and smile, 'cause your looking down here with your heart of gold.
And in the silence, your'll be resting your soul.
