<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Lonely">
It's nearly midnight
And I'm just about to leave
You promised you would be here
One more promise I believed
You dropped me like a bad boy
With no apology
You think I'm good for you
But that's not good enough for me
Why should I keep loving you?
When all I do boy is hurt
Why should I keep loving you?
I know I don't deserve
Everything that you've put me through
You're breaking my heart a little harder
I'm better off, I'm better off
I'm better off lonely
My friends all say I'm stupid
Staying close to you so long
I try to tell them that this kinda love
Ain't wrong
It started so well
Where did all the good stars go?
You said you'd take me higher
But I've never felt so low
Why should I keep loving you?
When all I do boy is hurt
Why should I keep loving you?
I know I don't deserve
Everything that you've put me through
You're breaking my heart a little harder
I'm better off, I'm better off
I'm better off lonely
Never wanna feel the way I felt
You made me feel bad about myself
Leave now baby, take what's yours
Ain't gonna be a fool no more
Ain't gonna be a fool
Why should I keep loving you?
Why should I keep loving you?
I'm better off lonely
Why should I keep loving you?
When all I do boy is hurt
(Do boy is hurt)
Why should I keep loving you?
(You)
I know I don't deserve
(I don't deserve)
Everything that you've put me through
You're breaking my heart a little harder
I'm better off, I'm better off
I'm better off lonely
