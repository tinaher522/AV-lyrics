<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Cry_Baby">
I got to break it to you
Feels so incredible not to need you no more
Save it, your story ain't true
'Cause I saw your new friend and baby I ain't no fool
'Cause you wreck my night
Feeding me the same old lies
Saying that you left something behind
Just to come back around
To come back around
You must be high
To think that I'd ever, ever come back to you baby
You're so high
'Cause I know you've never been good to me
Go ahead and cry, cry, cry
Baby, cry, cry, cry
Baby, cry, baby over me
You little cry, cry, cry
Baby, It's good bye
Baby cry, baby, over me
Ooh boy, you're officially screwed
Now your walls painted black, 'cause you can't get me back
Take boys, I turn it on you
Now you're calling me up, when you're drinking too much
And you wreck my mind,
You repeat the same old lies
Saying that you left something behind
And you come back around
You come back around
You must be high
To think that I'd ever, ever come back to you baby
You're so high
'Cause I know you've never been good to me
Go ahead and cry, cry, cry
Baby, cry, cry, cry
Baby, cry, baby over me
You little cry, cry, cry
Baby, It's good bye
Baby cry, baby, over me
God only knows why you do this to yourself
Try to move on but you're giving me hell
You say better the devil that you know
Is that some kind of joke?
Stop, stop
What you do, do
To yourself, self
Baby begging doesn't suit you
Stop, stop
What you do, do
To yourself, self
To yourself
You must be high
To think that I'd ever, ever come back to you baby
You're so high
'Cause I know you've never been good to me
Go ahead and cry, cry, cry
Baby, cry, cry, cry
Baby, cry, baby over me
You little cry, cry, cry
Baby, It's good bye
Baby cry, baby, over me
Cry
Go ahead and cry
