Spoken:
- What's the matter with you, you seem so sad? Didn't he take you to the movies?
- I just don't get it.. He says I'm not this enough, he says I'm not that enough.. Why can't he just like me the way I am?
Chorus:
If I changed for you, would you like me, like me more?
If I came to you, would it be different, than before..
Verse 1:
Don't wanna let get go but you've got to know, what you're asking o me is impossible, it's up to you if you want to see this through and take me as I am.
(Do it do it do it my way) Take me as I am (Do it do it do it my way)
Chorus:
If I changed for you, would you like me, like me more?
If I came to you, would it be different, than before..
Verse 2:
If I did it your way, you should say I would, it wouldn't be me and you'll see me unhappy, someday you should understand the way I am.. and take my way.
(Do it do it do it my way) And do it my way (Do it do it do it my way)
Bridge:
So if changed for you, it wouldn't be good so I guess I should .. Change you..
(Do it do it do it my way) Changeeeeee you! - Cos I'm gonna replace ya baby (Do it do it do it my way) 
I Cant hate you any longer baby - This mess wont make are life stronger .. No No No No No gotta move on, with or without you .. yeahhhh..
Chorus:
If I changed for you, would you like me, like me more?
If I came to you, would it be different, than before..
(Do it do it do it my way) My way baby (Do it do it do it my way).
