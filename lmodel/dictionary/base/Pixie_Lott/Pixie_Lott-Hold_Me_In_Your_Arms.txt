<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Hold_Me_In_Your_Arms">
Watching the world float on by
I can say I'm alright
Watching the sun light the moon
As the day turns to night
And he says don't you know I love you?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
He says everyday is special
You have made me believe
Hold me in your arms 'cause I'm falling
Hold me in your arms while we're sleeping
Hold me in your arms
Dreaming of soft cotton clouds
I feel close to you now
Dreaming of candy and chocolate
All that bad girls not allowed
And he says as he thinks I'm sleeping
He whispers girl, you are the one
Never thought I could feel this way
Girl, you made me believe
Hold me in your arms 'cause I'm falling
Hold me in your arms while we're sleeping
Hold me in your arms
Though I'm a little scared that all the times we shared
Almost too perfect to ever last
And when I'm lying here and you are holding me
I know the fear in me will pass
Hold me
Hold me in your arms 'cause I'm falling
Hold me in your arms while we're sleeping
Hold me, hold me, hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms 'cause I'm falling
Hold me in your arms while we're sleeping
Hold me, hold me, hold me in your arms
