<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="I_Wish_I_Was_There">
All my friends are going out 
But I've been thinking 
Maybe I better stay in bed 
The ceiling's spinning round 
Like I've been drinking 
I've got this banging in my head 
Boom boom boom boom 
I need my-yy medicine 
And the cure ain't Aspirin 
I don't care about tomor-o-o-oh 
Here we go again, here we go again 
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-or 
When this party ends, when this party ends 
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!) 
Never wanna say 
I I wish that I been there 
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!) 
Never wanna say 
I I wish that I been there 
Ooooooh 
Ooooooh 
I sleep through the alarm 
Head under pillow 
I know I'm gonna pay for this 
I can't stand missing out 
So when you call me, call me 
I say okay if you insist 
Boom boom boom boom 
I need my-yy medicine 
And the cure ain't Aspirin 
I don't care about tomor-o-o-oh 
Here we go again, here we go again 
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-or 
When this party ends, when this party ends 
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!) 
Never wanna say 
I I wish that I been there 
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!) 
Never wanna say 
I I wish that I been there 
Ooooooh 
Ooooooh 
Ooooooh 
Never wanna stay 
I wish I was there 
Ooooooh 
Ooooooh 
Ooooooh 
Never wanna stay 
I wish I was there 
Never wanna stay 
I wish I was there 
I don't care about tomor-o-o-oh 
Here we go again, here we go again 
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-or 
When this party ends, when this party ends 
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!) 
Never wanna say 
I I wish that I been there 
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!) 
Never wanna say 
I I wish that I been there
