<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Stevie_On_The_Radio">
I'll be there when the train stops
In that old '64 truck
In that sundress you like a lot
Fresh squeezed lemonade for you on the rocks babe
Cause I know it's been a long ride
And I'm sure it's hot in your Levi's
But I'll be your breeze in the sunshine
Make you sweeter than the sprinkles on mama's apple pie
And I'll be playing your favourite song yeah
Screwing up the words till you sing along
Bumpy roads, pedal down to the floor
I will ride with you until the wheels fall off
Throw your hands in the air
Cause we're young we don't care
Oh don't forget this
We could get reckless
Throw your heartache away
We can live for today
Baby I'll show you how to roll
Throw your hands in the air
Cause we're young we don't care
Oh don't forget this
We could be reckless
Got the sun on my face
Let's go back to the place
Where everyone will let it go
Cause Stevie's on the radio
Highway patrol couldn't stop us
We'll take a detour 'round the roadblock
Turn my simple ride into a good rush
There's no way barricades are gonna ruin the fun
We could be in for a long night
But when you ride shotgun I'm alright
I feel like a new Bonnie and Clyde
Get your feet up on the dash and just enjoy the ride
And I'll be playing your favorite song yeah
Screwing up the words till you sing along
Bumpy roads, pedal down to the floor
I will ride with you until the wheels fall off
Throw your hands in the air
Cause we're young we don't care
Oh don't forget this
We could get reckless
Throw your heartache away
We can live for today
Baby I'll show you how to roll
Throw your hands in the air
Cause we're young we don't care
Oh don't forget this
We could be reckless
Got the sun on my face
Let's go back to the place
Where everyone will let it go
And Stevie's on the radio
Throw your hands in the air
Cause we're young we don't care
Oh don't forget this
We could be reckless
Throw your heartache away
We can live for today
Baby I'll show you how to roll
Throw your hands in the air
Cause we're young we don't care
Oh don't forget this
We could be reckless
Got the sun on my face
Let's go back to the place
Where everyone will let it go
And Stevie's on the radio
