<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Bright_Lights_(Good_Life),_Pt._2">
Feels like my clock run out
I can only see when I'm looking down
Trying to find a way out of this guillotine
I can go through another day
Wishing my whole life away
I'm just not gonna lose my faith in me
And it seems this time I had enough
I'm putting my hand up, I hate the way I feeling lost
And my way succeed
Everybody is hustling, got to find where I fit in
I know, I know the end is where it begins
'Cause [unverified] and good life, keep calling up my name
And I trace somehow something's gonna change
Bright light in the sky light won't let me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow something's gonna change
