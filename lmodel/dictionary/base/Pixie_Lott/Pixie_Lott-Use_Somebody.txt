<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Use_Somebody">
oh, whoa, whoa
oh, whoa, whoa 
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
painted faces fill the places I can't reach
you know that I could use somebody, yeah
you know that I could use somebody, yeah
someone like you and all you know and how you speak
countless lovers undercover of the street
I know that I could use somebody, yeah
you know that I could use somebody, yeah
someone like you whoa, whoa, whoa
someone like you whoa, whoa, whoa
off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
waging wars to shake the poets and the street, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice, hey, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
someone like me oh, whoa, whoa
someone like me oh, whoa, whoa
I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now,
I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now,
oh, whoa,
someone like you
you know that I could use somebody, yeah
you know that I could use somebody, yeah, whoa
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
