<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="I_Want_You_Back">
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please, let me back in your heart?
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Yes, I do now
Ooh, ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na
Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the boy
I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please, let me back in your heart?
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Yes, I do now
Ooh, ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na
Uh, huh
A, buh, buh, buh, buh
A, buh, buh, buh, buh
All I want
A, buh, buh, buh, buh
All I need
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please, let me back in your heart?
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Yes, I do now
Ooh, ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na
