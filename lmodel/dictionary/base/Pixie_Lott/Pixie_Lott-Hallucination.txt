<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Hallucination">
Loving me, loving me
We are so in sync, baby
Happy like always right
This is where I want to be
My eyes are closed
Your hands on mine
Our hearts beat at the same time
No way of snapping out of this
This isn't real
Just what I feel
You slip away and I wait
I don't want to wait
Oh, it means that this ain't love
Don't tell me this is
My hallucination
Got me going again
Just imagination
More than we can regain
Got me going again
This is real
Nothing like, we're so tight
This is more than in my mind?
Got so loud, can't get out
And I know there is some time
My head is tripping on a chance
Your eyes are lost in my face
But wait I didn't scare me too
This isn't real
Just what I feel
You slip away and I'm missing you
If I can't have you
Oh, it means that this ain't love
Don't tell me this is
My hallucination
Got me going again
Just imagination
More than we can regain
Got me going again
This is real
I don't know the middle 8
I'm gonna make it up on the spot
Oh, shall we go into the chorus?
Oh, it means that this ain't love
Don't tell me this is
My hallucination
Got me going again
Just imagination
More than we can regain
Got me going again
This is real
One more time
Oh, this is real
