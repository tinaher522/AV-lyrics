<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="You_Win">
I'm a shot caller
I don't get caught up
I always have the upper hand
I'm a born winner
Even when I'm in love
I never gave it all to my man
You came in then snuck up on me
I'm facing my first defeat
I said I would never be a silly fool
But look what you've done to me
Said I would never lose, but you came in changed the rules
You win, I love it
I don't care anymore 'cause who's keeping score
You win, I love it
My heart is the prize, it's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
It's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
Its yours every time
You're my front runner
Number one stunner
Know you've got me under your spell
A champion lover
I'll never find another
Cupids arrow pierced through my shirt
I'm waving my white flag, it's surrender
I'm giving you all I have
I said I would never be a silly fool
But look what you've done to me
Said I would never lose, but you came in changed the rules
You win, I love it
I don't care anymore 'cause who's keeping score
You win, I love it
My heart is the prize, it's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
It's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
Its yours every time
Turn me upside down
Turn me inside out
Spin my world around
Take my breath away
Love's a losing game
Want the world to know
You win, I love it
I don't care anymore 'cause who's keeping score
You win, I love it
My heart is the prize, it's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
It's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
It's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
It's yours every time, you win
A, aaa, a, aaaa, la, la, la,
I'm yours every time, you win
