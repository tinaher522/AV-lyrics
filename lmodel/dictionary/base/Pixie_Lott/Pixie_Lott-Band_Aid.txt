<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Band_Aid">
When I met you I didn't really like you
First impression was you were somebody who'd
Walk right by when I waved at you and say 'Hi'
But they say (Hey)
Bad beginnings make happy endings
Now that I know you
I begin to understand things
Its turned around a hundred and eighty degrees
I found my missing piece
There's something about you
That's like the sun
You warm up my heart
When I come undone
You're like my soulmate
And on those days
When I hurt
When I break
You are my band aid
You are, you are
When I hurt, when I break
You are
You are, you are
When I hurt, when I break
You are
When I get caught in the rain and it feels like
There is no one in the world who understands my
Complications that I'm facing on certain days
I talk it through with you
No matter how I try to hide
You see straight through my disguise
You know how to fix me you are my therapy
(Baby, oooo)
There's something about you
That's like the sun
You warm up my heart
When I come undone
You're like my soulmate
And on those days
When I hurt
When I break
You are my band aid
You are, you are
When I hurt, when I break
You are
You are, you are
When I hurt, when I break
You are
Isn't it funny how these things can turn around
Just when I thought I knew you
You proved me wrong
I used the hate the things you love
And love the things you hate
But now I
Like it
I like it
I like it
Now I la la la la like it
I like it
I like it
la la la la like it
I like it
I like it
There's something about you
That's like the sun
You warm up my heart
When I come undone
You're like my soulmate
And on those days
When I hurt
When I break
You are my band aid
You are, you are
When I hurt, when I break
You are
You are, you are
La la la la la la la la la la like it
I like it
I like it
Now I la la la la like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
La la la la la la la la like it
I like it
I like it
I like it, Oh
i like it
I like it
I like it
