<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Champion">
I'll fight for love
I'll prove to you
I got the moves like no one else
Boy, she's a fool
She's telling lies and talking jive
She can go to hell
Come on ring that bell
If she's Apollo Creed,
I'll be Rocky Balboa
When I'm down on my knees
That's when baby, I'll show ya
I'll fight for your heart,
I'll be your Champion, Champion.
You're the prize, you sting me
Though you're floating like a butterfly
But I feel alive
You know why
I love you even more than any other guy
For you I'd die
If she's Apollo Creed,
I'll be Rocky Balboa
When I'm down on my knees
That's when baby, I'll show ya
I'll fight for your heart,
I'll be your champion.
I'm gonna rumble in the jungle
Be as sweet as vanilla
Prove my love to you,
In a twelve round thriller
I'll fight for your heart,
I'll be your champion, Champion.
I'm gonna use my lips, use my hips
Wrap you 'round my fingertips
Just to prove I love you, baby
If she's Apollo Creed,
I'll be Rocky Balboa
When I'm down on my knees
That's when baby, I'll show ya
I'll fight for your heart,
I'll be your champion,
I'll be your champion.
I'll fight for your heart,
I'll be your champion
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm gonna rumble in the jungle
Be as sweet as vanilla
Prove my love to you,
In a twelve round thriller
I'll fight for your heart,
I'll be your champion, Champion
I'll fight for your heart,
I'll be your champion, Champion.
