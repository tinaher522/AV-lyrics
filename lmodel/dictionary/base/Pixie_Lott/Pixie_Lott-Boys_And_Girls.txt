<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Boys_And_Girls">
I'm looking in the mirror and I think I'm liking what I see
Big pink lights shining bright like I'm on the T.V.
My heart pumps as the bass drum thumps
You gotta move when the floorboard jumps
Something's going on and I think it's going on right now.
All the boys and the girls they got it going on
When the beat kicks ya' feel it in in your bones
When the basement cracks and the needle drops
You can't turn back no you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls.
I can see the silhouettes dancing up against the wall
It sure feels good, feels good
Yeah we're gonna lose control
Turn it on make it strong
A good beat never hurt no-one
Kicking up the dust and we're making every move we know.
All the boys and the girls they got it going on
When the beat kicks ya' feel it in your bones
When the basement cracks and the needle drops
You can't turn back 
No you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stops.
Wooooh oooh, baby don't stop
Wooooh oooh, keep the vibe hot
Wooooh oooh, baby don't stop
Wooooh oooh, keep the vibe hot
Turn it on, make it strong, a good beat never hurt no-one.
(He-ey ye-e-ah)
All the boys and the girls they got it going on
When the beat kicks ya' feel it in your bones
When the basement cracks and the needle drops
You can't turn back and 
NO you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
(He-ey ye-e-ah)
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
All the boys and the girls
No you just can't stop.
