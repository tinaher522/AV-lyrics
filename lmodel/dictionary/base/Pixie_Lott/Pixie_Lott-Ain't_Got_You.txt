<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Ain't_Got_You">
All I ever wanted was to love you
Boy I never meant to cause you pain
And I only got myself to blame
Now you're gone, I can't stop thinking of you
Everytime I hear your name
I think of what I've done, again and again
See, I'm all alone tonight
With just a memory
And baby you're a million miles away
I can't take another day
If I ain't got you
I ain't got anything
It just don't feel the same
No, if I ain't got you, oh
And If I ain't got you
I ain't got anything
I can't even feel the pain
No if I ain't got you, you, you
Baby, I'll remember when we were together
I'll remember how you used to say
There was nothing I could do to turn you away
I know, I know that things are changed forever
When I look into your eyes
Oh, I see now the tears that you cried
See, I'm all alone tonight
With just a memory
And baby you're a million miles away
I can't take another day
If I ain't got you
I ain't got anything
It just don't feel the same
No, if I ain't got you, woah
And If I ain't got you
I ain't got anything
I can't even feel the pain
No if I ain't got,
If I ain't got you
If I could, I would pick up the pieces of your broken heart
And I'd put it back together, woah
And I would, I would hold you in my arms until the hurting stops
Don't you know I'll stay right here forever, oh no
Listen
All I ever wanted was to love you
Boy I never meant to cause you pain
And I only got myself to blame
If I ain't got you
I ain't got anything
It just don't feel the same
No, if I ain't got you, woah
If I ain't got you
I ain't got anything
I can't even feel the pain
No if I ain't got,
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
I got nothing, baby
It just don't feel the same
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
I ain't got anything
I can't even feel the pain
If I ain't got you
All I ever wanted was to love you
Boy I never meant to cause you pain
And I only got myself to blame
