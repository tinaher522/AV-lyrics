<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Nasty">
Come on, I just do it, uh
I do it, uh
I do 'til youâ€™re good and tired
I was sitting all alone yeah
A lot on my mind
I felt a tap on my shoulder
And I rolled my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man telling me lies
But how can a girl say "No" when you flash that sexy smile?
And you say
Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe
Hey, hey
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type (boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type
In the middle of the floor yeah
I just don't care
Take my body so low now
The crowd stops and stares
Let 'em say what they want but I'm feelin' it and it's for you baby
Tell me how can a girl say "No" when you're calling out to me?
And you say
Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe
Hey, hey
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type (boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type
What's your fantasy? (ooh nasty nasty)
Tell them all to me (ooh nasty nasty)
Don't you be afraid (ooh nasty nasty)
Share your nasty secret baby yeah
Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe
Hey, hey
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
(Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type (boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
Boy you're just so
