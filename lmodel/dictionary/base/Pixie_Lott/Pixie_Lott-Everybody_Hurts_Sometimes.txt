<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Everybody_Hurts_Sometimes">
I don't know how to turn it all around
When I feel hopeless, can't see my way out
Now I'm so low, how will I ever get back up
When I am broken and I've just had enough
Pick up the pieces and I'll put myself back together
Crying it out there's no doubt that it's got to get better
And it's alright to go ahead and let your tears fall down
When everything crashes to the ground
And it's alright, no one ever makes it out alive
Everybody hurts sometimes, times
It's so hard not to let emotion burst
To my head, upside down on a thread
Cut me loose so I can stand straight up again
And fill up this bitter empty space
Pick up the pieces and I'll put myself back together
Crying there's no doubt that it's got to get better
And it's alright to go ahead and let your tears fall down
When everything crashes to the ground
And it's alright, no one ever makes it out alive
Everybody hurts sometimes, times
Sometimes, times
So when you're stuck
And can't move on
You will learn to cry
We all get hurt sometimes
And it's alright to go ahead and let your tears fall down
When everything crashes to the ground
And it's alright, no one ever makes it out alive
Everybody hurts sometimes, times
Sometimes, times
Ooohhh,oh sometimes
