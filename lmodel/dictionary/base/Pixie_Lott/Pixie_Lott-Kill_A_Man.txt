<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Kill_A_Man">
Oh, you're a worthless man
You don't call me back
You don't give a damn
You're a maniac
You're a jealous guy
You're a hypocrite
Got a wandering eye
Don't want none of it
You gon' have to go
Pack your shit and leave
I'm taking control
Crossing all my T's
I'm done
But you keep me on the line
Keep messin' with my mind, yeah
What you doin' to me baby?
Here is somethin' you can't understand
(How I can just kill a man)
You do me wrong with my heart in your hands
(Now I can just kill a man)
This was never a part of my plan
(How I can just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand
(How I can just kill a man)
You don't want me for yourself
But don't let me have no-one else.
You're a mess around
You don't give me time
You just shoot me down
You done crossed the line
You're a heartless fool
You don't take no blame
You won't never change
i'm a cock and aim
You gon' have to go
Pack your shit and leave
I'm taking control
Crossing all my T's
I'm done
But you keep me on the line
Keep messin' with my mind, yeah
What you doin' to me baby?
Here is somethin' you can't understand
(How I can just kill a man)
You do me wrong with my heart in your hands
(Now I can just kill a man)
This was never a part of my plan
(How I can just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand
(How I can just kill a man)
You don't want me for yourself
But don't let me have no-one else.
Ladies (Uh-hu)
Is he givin' you what you're looking for? (Hell, no)
Ladies (Uh-hu)
Is he blowin' through the final straw? (Hell, no)
Ladies (Uh-hu)
Don't it feel like you can't take no more? (Hell, yeah)
Maybe (Uh-hu)
'Bout time we go to war.
Here is somethin' you can't understand
(How I can just kill a man)
You do me wrong with my heart in your hands
(Now I can just kill a man)
This was never a part of my plan
(How I can just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand
(How I can just kill a man)
You don't want me for yourself
But don't let me have no-one else.
