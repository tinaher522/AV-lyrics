<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="I_Wish_I_Was_There-Here_We_Go_Again">
All my friends are going out
but I've been thinking
maybe I better stay in bed
The ceiling's spinning round
like I've been drinking
I've got this banging in my head
boom boom boom boom
I need my-yy medicine
and the cure ain't Aspirin
I don't care about tomor-o-o-oh
here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-or
when this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
Never wanna say
I I wish that I been there
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
Never wanna say
I I wish that I been there
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
I sleep through the alarm
head under pillow
I know I'm gonna pay for this
I can't stand missing out
so when you call me, call me
I say okay if you insist
boom boom boom boom
I need my-yy medicine
and the cure ain't Aspirin
I don't care about tomor-o-o-oh
here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-or
when this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
Never wanna say
I I wish that I been there
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
Never wanna say
I I wish that I been there
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Never wanna stay
I wish I was there
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Never wanna stay
I wish I was there
Never wanna stay
I wish I was there
I don't care about tomor-o-o-oh
here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-or
when this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
Never wanna say
I I wish that I been there
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
Never wanna say
I I wish that I been there
