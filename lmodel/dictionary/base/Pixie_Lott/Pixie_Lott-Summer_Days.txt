<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Summer_Days">
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, zero
Wearing nothing
But a sombre dress on my body
We've come back
To all the emptiness and I
Feel the sun on my skin
Warming up my heart within
Counting the days
Lying in the park
Feeling the spark
Telling you stop
Doing nothing all day
(Day dreaming away)
Messing around
While I drown
Falling for somebody
I can't wait for those summer days
(Summer days)
Feel the sun shining on my face
(On my face)
Let someone take my breath away
And we'll see ooh, ooh, maybe
That someone is you
(It's you)
I've been riding on my back
Rolling down to the beach
Calling all my friends
To come swim with me
And the worries on my mind
I know that they are still there
I'm counting the days
I can't wait for those summer days
(Summer days)
Feel the sun shining on my face
(On my face)
Let someone take my breath away
And we'll see ooh, ooh, maybe
That someone is you
(It's you)
I can't wait for those summer days
(Summer days)
Feel the sun shining on my face
(On my face)
Let someone take my breath away
And we'll see ooh, ooh, maybe
That someone is you
(It's you)
