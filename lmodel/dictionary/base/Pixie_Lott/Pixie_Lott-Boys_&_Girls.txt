<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Boys_&_Girls">
I’m looking in the mirror and I think I’m liking what I see.
Big, pink lights shining bright, like I’m on the T.V.
My heart pumps as the bass drum thumps, you gotta move when the floorboard jumps.
Something’s going on and I think it’s going on right now.
All the boys and the girls they got it going on.
When the beat kicks in you feel it in your bones.
When the basement cracks and the needle drops.
You can’t turn back and you just can’t stop.
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls.
I can see the silhouettes dancing up against the wall.
It sure feels good, feels good, yeah we’re gonna lose control.
Turn it on, make it strong, a good beat never hurt no-one.
Kicking up the dust and we’re making every move we know, ye-e-ah.
All the boys and the girls they got it going on.
When the beat kicks in you feel it in your bones.
When the basement cracks and the needle drops.
You can’t turn back and you just can’t stop.
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
Wooooh oooh, baby don’t stop.
Wooooh oooh, keep the vibe up.
Wooooh oooh, baby don’t stop.
Wooooh oooh, keep the vibe up.
Turn it on, make it strong, a good beat never hurt no-one.
All the boys and the girls they got it going on.
When the beat kicks in you feel it in your bones.
When the basement cracks and the needle drops.
You can’t turn back and you just can’t stop.
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
All the boys and the girls (no you just can’t stop).
