<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Love_You_To_Death">
I bring out the best in you
But you bring out the worst in me
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you)
But you don't give me anything
Wish that I was strong enough to weather this storm
My friends are saying they don't recognise me from before
And when I say I'm good you don't believe me anymore
'Cause you know that I'll always be there
Maybe that's why you don't care
So just take it all
And watch how I fall
Always thinking you'll catch me
You are killing me slowly
I keep hold of my breath
Because I love you to death
I love you to death
I love you to death
You're the reason I still hope
You're the reason I still choke
Used to be your love would take my hurt away (away)
But now you love to watch me break
How am I supposed to leave if you refuse to let me go
Don't know how I ever let you have so much control
Every time you feeling, how you make me feel so low
'Cause you know that I'll always be there
Maybe that's why you don't care
So just take it all
And watch how I fall
Always thinking you'll catch me
You are killing me slowly
I keep hold of my breath
Because I love you to death
I love you to death
I love you to death
Every time you come back I'm believing
But I know that you don't really mean it
You're so good being bad that I buy it
Every time you come around
You're the reason I still hope
You're the reason I still choke
'Cause you know that I'll always be there
Maybe that's why you don't care
So just take it all
And watch how I fall
Always thinking you'll catch me
You are killing me slowly
I keep hold of my breath
Because I love you to death
I love you to death
I love you to death
