<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Apologize">
I'm holding on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
I'm hearing what you say,
But i just can't make a sound.
You tell me that you need me,
Then you go and cut me down.
But wa-a-it.
Tell me that you're sorry,
Didn't think i'd turn around.
And sa-a-y
That it's too late to apologize,
It's too late-e-e.
Said it's too late to apologize,
It's too late-e-e.
Ooooh wait-t-t, yeah yeah
I'd take another chance,
Take a fall take a shot for you.
I need you like a heart needs a beat,
But that's nothing new.
Yeah yeah.
I loved you with the fire red,
Now it's turning blue.
And you sa-a-y.
Sorry like and angel,
Heaven let me think was you.
Now i'm afraid-d-d
That it's too late to apologize,
It's too late-e-e.
Said it's too late to apologize,
It's too late-e-e.
Said it's too late to apologize,
It's too late-e-e.
Yeah-e-yeah.
Said it's too late to apologize,
It's too late-e-e.
Yeah-e-yeah-h-h.
Holding on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
