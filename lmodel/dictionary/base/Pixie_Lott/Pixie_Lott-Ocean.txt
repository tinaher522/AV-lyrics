<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Ocean">
There's an ocean
pouring from my eyes
Build a boat and 
catch the rising ride
I'm so over yesterday
Now just watch me sail away
On this ocean
All the tears I cried
It's deep in the night
I miss you most
That's my worst time 
Gotta reach for the light
Killing the shadows 
Of that other life
Echoes round my mind forever
I thought we would stay together
Now I've gonna kiss it all goodbye
There's an ocean 
Pouring from my eyes
One emotion rising like the tide
And there's nothing I can say
As I watch you drift away
On this ocean every tear I cry
Look what life did to me
I'm lucky to get out alive
The wound goes so deep
I took a bullet when you left my life 
Echoes round my mind forever
I thought we would stay together
Now I've gonna kiss it all goodbye
There's an ocean 
Pouring from my eyes
One emotion rising like the tide
And there's nothing I can say
As I watch you drift away
On this ocean every tear I cry
(Can't stop ocean of my tear drops Rise up ocean of my tear drops)
Oh- Can't stop ocean of my tear drops
Rise up 
There's an ocean 
Pouring from my eyes
One emotion since we said goodbye
I'm so over yesterday 
Now just watch me sail away
On this ocean every tear I've cried
Oh, forever 
Together
Forever and ever and ever together 
Oh
Together
