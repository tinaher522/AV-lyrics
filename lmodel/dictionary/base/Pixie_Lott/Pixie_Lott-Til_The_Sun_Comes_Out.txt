<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Til_The_Sun_Comes_Out">
Wake up with a feeling
Is got me up on the ceiling
And you are not gonna knock me down
I wanna for where the sun shines
I wanna go where the good times
Are not gonna get me down
So keep saying what you say
Gonna make me stronger anyway
When you say I am not good enough
Just keeps me climbing to the top
Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep me dancing
Till the sun comes out
Ain't gonna wait for no one
Can't stop me now
Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep me dancing
Till the sun comes out
So I act like I don't care
Cause I don't care
Gonna keep on keep on grooving
Every .. I got my way â€¦
Gonna keep on keep on grooving
So keep saying what you say
Gonna make me stronger anyway
When you say I am not good enough
Just keeps me climbing to the top
Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep me dancing
Till the sun comes out
Ain't gonna wait for no one
Can't stop me now
Never gonna bring me down
Gonna keep me dancing
Till the sun comes out
