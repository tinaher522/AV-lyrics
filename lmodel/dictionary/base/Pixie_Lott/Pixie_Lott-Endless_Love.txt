<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Endless_Love">
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
(Yeah)
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
(And I,I,I)
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
(Uuh, uuh)
And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And Forever
(Forever)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
(No, no, no, no, no)
