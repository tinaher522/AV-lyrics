<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Particular">
Hearing it before on bad terms, bad terms
I'll never get with you
I'll never ever listen what the neighbors say
Or don't say, it's so predictable
I've heard it all a million times, or maybe more
Same old story
It's boring, I'm snoring
Wake me up in the morning
I'm particular 'bout, who I get with
It's ridiculous to even think
That you're in with a chance
Oh, you must be tripping boy
Oh, you're my whipping boy
Not with that chat
That's not where it's at
I'm just a little bit more particular
You turn up all uninvited, no surprises
'Cause my memory
It serves me well, just laugh again
You did the same thing that you always did
Hammering me with
Phone calls, texts and downloads
It's boring, I'm snoring
Wake me up in the morning
I'm particular 'bout, who I get with
It's ridiculous to even think
That you're in with a chance
Oh, you must be tripping boy
Oh, you're my whipping boy
Not with that chat
That's not where it's at
I'm just a little bit more particular
It's boring, I'm snoring
Wake me up in the morning
I'm particular 'bout, who I get with
It's ridiculous to even think
That you're in with a chance
Oh, you must be tripping boy
Oh, you're my whipping boy
Not with that chat
That's not where it's at
I'm just a little bit more particular
It's boring, I'm snoring
Wake me up in the morning
I'm particular 'bout, who I get with
It's ridiculous to even think
That you're in with a chance
Oh, you must be tripping boy
Oh, you're my whipping boy
Not with that chat
That's not where it's at
I'm just a little bit more particular
It's boring, I'm snoring
Wake me up in the morning
I'm particular 'bout, who I get with
It's ridiculous to even think
That you're in with a chance
Oh, you must be tripping boy
Oh, you're my whipping boy
Not with that chat
That's not where it's at
I'm just a little bit more particular
