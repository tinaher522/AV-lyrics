<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Jack">
Jack was nimble
Jack, he was quick
Jack could jump right over the candle stick
Now he's gone and I'm burning
All alone
Yeah he's gone and I'm burning still, oh no
A beautiful story left incomplete
Ooh, how he knocked me off my feet
Sitting by my window pane
Thinking I might go insane
Why'd he only shoot me halfway to the moon
And I can't get over that, over that
Baby after loving Jack
There's no going back, going back
Jack and Jill they went up that hill
To fetch a pail of water but there was a spill
And Jill came tumbling down, all alone
All came tumbling down, oh no
Pulled to the ground by gravity
Will it remain a mystery
Sitting by my window pane
Thinking I might go insane
Why'd he only shoot me halfway to the moon
And I can't get over that, over that
Baby after loving Jack
There's no going back, going back
A beautiful story left incomplete
Ooh, how he knocked me off of my feet
Sitting by my window pane
Thinking I might go insane
Why'd he only shoot me halfway to the moon
And I can't get over that, over that
Baby after loving Jack
There's no going back, going back
Oh no, no, after loving Jack
There's no going back
