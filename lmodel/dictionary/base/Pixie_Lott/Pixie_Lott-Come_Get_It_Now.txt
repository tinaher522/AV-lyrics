<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Come_Get_It_Now">
Na, na, eh, eh, slow (come get it now)
Ooooh (come get it now)
Ooooh (come get it now)
Ooooh (come get it )
I'm tired of watching you dance with your lazy two left feet
Throw some junk in to it if you wanna keep up with me (come get it now)
High speed on the dance floor, I'll get you into shape
Boy you're looking like you want more, I'll push you till you break (come get it now)
Oh, you're moving too slow
Tonight's all we got
You're losing my attention, I'm letting you know
Your moves are too slow, I say
Hey, hey, come get it now, no stroking no more walking
I say hey, hey, come get it now, up your speed to get with me
Get your sh*t together, lets not muck about
My glass is almost empty and the song is near played out (come get it now)
Get in on the action, gotta put your rights to wrong
Lets take it to the back and we'll go all night long (come get it now)
Oh, you're moving too slow
Tonight's all we got
You're losing my attention, I'm letting you know
Your moves are too slow
Come and get it, get down tonight
Tonight is all we got
Lets take it take it till the morning light
Now once more round the block
Come and get it, get down tonight
Tonight is all we got
Lets take it take it till the morning light
Now once more round the block
Oh, you're moving too slow
Tonight's all we got
You're losing my attention, I'm letting you know
Your moves are too slow
