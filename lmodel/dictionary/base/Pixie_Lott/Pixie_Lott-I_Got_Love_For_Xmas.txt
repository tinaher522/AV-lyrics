<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="I_Got_Love_For_Xmas">
You were always just a friend to me
But I felt something change that night
Yeah, you walked me home on Christmas Eve
And we laughed so hard, we cried
That's the moment when we kissed
I closed my eyes and made a wish that...
I got love for Christmas
It's just what I wanted
It's all that I wanted
Your sweet love and kisses
Are just what I wanted
So, Merry Christmas, Darlin'
Snow, falls softly on the street at night
Making the whole world look brand new
The stars, were twinkling like the Christmas lights
As I moved in close to you
I knew right then when we kissed
That I had one thing on my list and...
I got love for Christmas
It's just what I wanted
It's all that I wanted
Your sweet love and kisses
Are just what I wanted
So, Merry Christmas, Darlin'
Don't need to check twice
To be naughty is nice
I can't have too much 
Of the stuff that you give me
You give me so good
One taste of your lips
One song that it slips
To all, all, all
I, I got love for Christmas
It's all that I wanted
It's all that I wanted, Darlin'
I got love for Christmas
It's just what I wanted
It's all that I wanted
