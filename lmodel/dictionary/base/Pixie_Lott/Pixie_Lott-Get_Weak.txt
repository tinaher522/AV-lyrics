<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Get_Weak">
Yesterday, I saw you eatin' your lunch
In the changing room by yourself
I tried to get in, you lock yourself in
How can I help?
You thought that I wouldn't notice
You wearing baggy clothes
And tryin' to hide the bruises
But I'm not stupid
You're not around anymore
You call in sick with all your fabricated excuses
I try to call you up but you don't answer the phone
To be honest, this is useless
It's obvious that you cried
But you say, there's something in your eye
Things are gonna go south
If you don't open your mouth
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em bully you like that
When you fast forward five years
You'll be laughing off those tears
Now they use their fists to win
But when life kicks in
They'll move rubbish bins
Though the struggles made you stronger
You won't any longer,
Get weak, get weak, get weak, yeah
I see you walkin' up and down the stairs
Pretending you are busy
Lettin' nobody know you wanna' be alone
Coverin' up your story
I wish I could rescue you and talk it through
But you think everybody's out to get you
But that's not true
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Brush them off your shoulder
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
If your friends if your friends
Try to change you, change you
Maybe it's time, its time
To change your friend
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
Don't let 'em get into your head
