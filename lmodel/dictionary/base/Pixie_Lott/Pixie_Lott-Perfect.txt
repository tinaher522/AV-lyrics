<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="Perfect">
Love your hair in the morning
Your stinky kiss without a warning
Don't go to work, stay in bed with me
We can lay, watch the tv
All day being naughty
I fall asleep then I see you in my dreams
As long as I breathe
I'm breathing for you
As long as I see
I'm looking for you
You don't even know
How much you deserve it
You make it worth it
You make it all perfect
In your eyes are the colours
That you hide, I discover
Little things that blow me away
I love your voice, makes me shiver
And the chills you deliver
I wanna see your face everyday
As long as I breathe
I'm breathing for you
As long as I see
I'm looking for you
You don't even know
How much you deserve it
You make it worth it
You make it all perfect
You make it worth it, you make it perfect (x4)
You make it worth it, you make it
We can lay, watch the tv
All day being naughty
I fall asleep then I see you in my dreams
As long as I breathe
I'm breathing for you
As long as I see
I'm looking for you
You don't even know
How much you deserve it
You make it worth it
You make it all perfect
(Make everything perfect)
