<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="When_Love_Takes">
It's complicated, it always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like I waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows
Head under water, now I can't breathe
I never felt so good
Now I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
Give me a reason, I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload?
And this time I blame you
Looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could lose it all
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And I'll be loving you all the time, it's true
'Cause I, I want to make it right with you
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
Baby, when the love takes over
Baby, when the love takes over
Baby, when the love, the love, the love
Baby, when the love takes over
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
