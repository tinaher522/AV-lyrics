<song artist="Pixie_Lott" title="My_Love">
My love, lately I see you just ain't with me
A distance growin', oh, how can this be?
Departing slowly and I don't know how to stop this wind
From the way we're goin' this love is fadin' away
Nobody knows but I know, yeah, I know
They don't see it but I feel it
Without you I never will be as strong
Oh, I need ya, oh, I need ya
You're the definition of a life I would be missin', oh
We can make this right, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose your love
I cannot live without you by my side
Take all my love, take my soul, my mind
Too much to let go, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose my love
You are my love, don't wanna lose my love
Running in circles, let's get it past the hassle
It ain't worth and this can't work, oh, baby
See my book is filled with so many pages of your memory
Let's finish the story, a never ending story
Nobody knows what I know, yeah, I know
I know you are, this is not just me
Without you I never will be as strong
So come on baby, show me
You're the definition of a life I would be missin', oh
We can make this right, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose your love
I cannot live without you by my side
Take all my love, take my soul, my mind
Too much to let go, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose my love
You are my love, don't wanna lose my love
You are my love, don' t wanna lose my love
Your love, your kiss, you are the guy I love
That belongs to me and I can't live without you
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose my love
You're the definition of a life I would be missin', oh
We can make this right
I cannot live without you by my side
Take all my love, take my soul, my mind
Too much to let go, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose my love
You're the definition of a life I would be missin', oh
We can make this right, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose your love
I cannot live without you by my side
Take all my love, take my soul, my mind
Too much to let go, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose my love
You are my love, don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose
You are my love, don' t wanna lose my love
