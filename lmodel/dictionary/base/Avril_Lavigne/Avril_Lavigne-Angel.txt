<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Angel">
[Verse 1]
I'm no angel thats for sure
Just please tell me why are these things happening to me?
I really love you,cause there's no limit to that,no way,no way
She doesn't love you she's using you to show you off,to her friends,
But baby that's not me,
[Chorus]
I guess I'm the Angel
The only one for you [You,you,you,you,you}
And if there was only [only] one thing I could do,
I wouldn't do it,because I love you,unlike her,
But why do you tourcher me?
I can't sleep at night baby
I was thinking I was your Angel
[Verse 2]
Two years from now I see the dance,
Looks like you gave our love another chance,
She's still lookin at you,despise in eyes,
I now know I'm the Angel fo you
Now I know it's no lie {no lie},
I guess my mind wasn't joking [joking]
About that,
[Chorus]
I'm the Angel, the one for you,
I'll tell no lies if you do that too,
But what if she steals your heart?
Then what do I do?
[Verse 3]
Baby,there's no stopping me from loving you
She didn't steal your heart yet,
What do I do till then?
I know I'm your Angel
The only one fo you
Angel....Angel.....
