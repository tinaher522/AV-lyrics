<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Give_Me_A_Bit">
Ba dum ba dum ba dum ba dum
Live in the life trusted in power feel all my rules i'm queen of the  the world I demand what I like, take a bit of what you like be so damn mean that I will just ditch you been so real that I just don't care.
I want this and that so hit it up alot or give me a bit thats you not me plus us I see i am the queen so give me a bit. ba dum ba dum
Whats with you now you refused to serve me  my water to get me full of it all. asking for a bit more water mr. you have gone way to  far so, 

I want this and that so hit it up alot or give me a bit thats you not me plus us I see i am the queen so give me a bit. ba dum ba dum
I still know no one is made of money but I will never stop wishing for this so give me a bit.  ba dum, a bit
I want this and that so hit it up alot or give me a bit thats you not me plus us I see i am the queen so give me a bit. ba dum ba dum
I want this and that so hit it up alot or give me a bit thats you not me plus us I see i am the queen so give me a bit. ba dum ba dum
