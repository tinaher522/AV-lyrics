<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Bitchin'_Summer">
Everyone is waiting on the bell
A couple seconds we'll be raising hell
The sun is shining down
School is finally out
And nothing matters so we might as well 
Everybody's bakin' in the sun
Come and party, do it while we're young
Move your shit, when you hear the drum
So put your hands up
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be living fast, kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast, make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer
Oh, bitchin' summer
Oh, bitchin' summer
Throwing empty bottles in the fire
Whiskey's got us singing like a choir
We're all gonna run
When the police come
But in the moment we are so alive
Everybody's bakin' in the sun
Come and party, do it while we're young
Move your s**t, when you hear the drum
So put your hands up
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be living fast, kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast, make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer
Oh, bitchin' summer
Oh, bitchin' summer
Right right right near the beach
The party don't stop
If we don't get harassed by the mother fuckin' cops
Quarter tank of gas, about a half a pack
My cellphone's dying, but there's no turning back
I can feel the breeze
Steering with my knees
Drumming on the dashboard bumpin' to the beat
Hit the windshield wiper
Searchin' for my lighter
I gotta get alright before this all-nighter
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be living fast, kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast, make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer
Oh, bitchin' summer
Oh, bitchin' summer
Pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer
