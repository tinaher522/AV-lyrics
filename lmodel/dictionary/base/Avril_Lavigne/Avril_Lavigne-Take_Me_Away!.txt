<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Take_Me_Away!">
Don't, don't, don't say no to anything
Yes, yes, say yes to everything
Just find a way... to get away (wanna runaway)
Let's take off the clothes and see if anybody notices
Then runaway, what d'you say? (when I'm okay)
Have a little joy, have a little faith...
Live life
Have a little hope, have a lot of fun
'Cause you... you
You never know
What people throw
To make you stop
I, I, I'm gonna try to let this life
Pick me up and take me away
Run up to a stranger
Kiss and tell them that you love them and then walk away
You made their day... (at least I hope you did)
Stand up in a restaurant, start dancing on a table
Then get kicked out for that behavior (that behavior)
Oops... I did it again
Have a little joy, have a little faith...
Live life
Have a little hope, have a lot of fun!
'Cause you... you
You never know
What people throw
To make you stop
I, I, I'm gonna try to let this life
Pick me up and take me away
Don't you know that nothing equals nothing?
Do anything, do everything, do something
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing!
You, you... you never know
What people throw
To make you stop
(I) Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You, you, (you never know) you never know
What people throw
To make you stop
I, I, (you never know) I'm gonna try to let this life
Pick me up and take me away! (away, 'way, 'way...)
