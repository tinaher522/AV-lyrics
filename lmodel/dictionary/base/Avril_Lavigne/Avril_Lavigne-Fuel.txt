<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Fuel">
Gimme Fuel
Gimme Fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ugh
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crash my head
Nitro Junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse
War head
Fuck 'em, man
White nuckle tight
Through black and white
Oh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burnin' hard
Lose and clean
And on I burn
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel 
Gimme fire 
Gimme that which I desire
Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future 
Spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah, yeah, ye-ah
Take the corner join the crash
Headlights
Alarms
Another drunk emits too fast
Yeah
That's way to fast, (goes) fast, (goes) fast, (goes)
Oh, on I burn 
Fuel is pumping engines
Burnin' hard 
Loose and clean
And on I burn
Turnin' my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Gimme fuel 
Gimme Fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ugh
Ye-ah
Oh, on I burn
Turnin' my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
On I burn
