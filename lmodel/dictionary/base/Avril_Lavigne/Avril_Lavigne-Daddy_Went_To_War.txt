<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Daddy_Went_To_War">
Daddy went to war, today
He taught the fella's who's boss
He's got loads of friends out there
such as Chas, Dave and Ross
Don't you know that I'm scared
cause Daddy went to war war war out there it's a snowy snowy day hey ya da ya you want to know why i said to you that daddy went to war.
