<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit">
Load up on guns
Bring your friends
It's fun to lose
And to pretend
She's over bored
and self assured
I know, I know
A dirty word
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello 
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My libido
yah
hey
hey
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello 
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My libido
yah
hey
hey
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard
It's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello how low?
hello hello hello 
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now
Entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My libido
a denial(x9)
