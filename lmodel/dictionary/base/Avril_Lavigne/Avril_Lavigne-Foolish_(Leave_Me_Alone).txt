<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Foolish_(Leave_Me_Alone)">
I guess I was foolish to understand
That fact that Im leaving my life and starting all over again,
One day sittin back looking at old memories,
Thinkin bout those little things that you told me,
But what if I wasn't jokin,
They're all lookin at those who are provokin,
Little things that worry me are about to end
Just like you and me being friends
If I knew that this was gonna happen,
Then I would of just said,
[Chorus]
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone' 
Dont go together that's what you said to me on the phone
But I dont think so,those are what I am.
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,
You're only foolish,that didn't go to my head
As little as you are you want left alone 
confusing as a dog that hates bones
Most girls love attention but I don't.
Think of me as a distraction 
Stoppping your work stopping your attraction
Little as I know.
I'm a girl who likes who no one would ever of dream of me thinking,
Little as I dont know.
Whatever caused me to stop the moment
The moment when I wished say I love you.
But my dreams go away
[Chorus]
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone' 
Dont go together that's what you said to me on the phone
But I dont think so,those are what I am.
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,
You're only foolish,that didn't go to my head
As little as you are you want left alone 
confusing as a dog that hates bones
Most girls love attention but I don't.
We're newlyweds thirteen years later
I'm dressed in a gown laying down,
My dream didn't fade.
