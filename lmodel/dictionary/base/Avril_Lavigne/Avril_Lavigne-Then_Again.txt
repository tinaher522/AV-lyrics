<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Then_Again">
I Though You Were My Friend
I Though I'd Play Again
And Then We Would Be Friends 
Then Again
I Wondered Why You'd Be
Very Good To Me
I Know You Were A Lie
Then Again
I Gotta Learn To Think A gain
You Never Ever Were My Friend
I Had To Think To Many Times
Then Again
Maybe You Can Be Nice
I Will Teach You Well
Step Up On The Stage
Then Again 
Oh So Very High
Way Up In The Sky
I Know You Are From Mars
Then Again
Reach Up Very High
Back Up To the Sky
I Know You Want To Go Home
Then Again
I Gotta Learn To Think A gain
You Never Ever Were My Friend
I Had To Think To Many Times
Then Again
Maybe You Can Be Nice

I Will Teach You Well
Step Up On The Stage
Then Again 
Then Again
Hear Me
Eat It
Now
Again
Get it
Always
It is time
Now or never3x
I Gotta Learn To Think A gain
You Never Ever Were My Friend
I Had To Think To Many Times
Then Again
Maybe You Can Be Nice
I Will Teach You Well
Step Up On The Stage
Then Again 
I Gotta Learn To Think A gain
You Never Ever Were My Friend
I Had To Think To Many Times
Then Again
Maybe You Can Be Nice
I Will Teach You Well
Step Up On The Stage
Then Again
