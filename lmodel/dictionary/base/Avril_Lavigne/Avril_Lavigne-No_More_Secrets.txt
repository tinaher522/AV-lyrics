<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="No_More_Secrets">
(Drum Solo) NO MORE NO MORE SECRETS 2x
Yelling Out In Your Face
That Is Such A Discrace 
And You Will Soon Be Here
Yelling Out In Your Ear 
Your Secrets Are Near The End
No More Secrets No More Time 
No More Secrets No More Lies
I Told Your Secret
To The World
No More Secrets No More Types
Yelling Out In Your Mouth
You Are Out Of Your House
And I Will Leave And Be Gone
Yelling Out On Your Arm
To Go Away 
No More Secrets No More Time 
No More Secrets No More Lies

I Told Your Secret
To The World
No More Secrets No More Types
Yeah I Know Your Secret
Oh She Has To Know
Yeah I Will Tell Her
Tell Her, Tell her, tell her
(Drum Solo)
No More Secrets No More Time 
No More Secrets No More Lies
I Told Your Secret
To The World
No More Secrets No More Types
No More Secrets No More Time 
No More Secrets No More Lies
I Told Your Secret
To The World
No More Secrets No More Types
