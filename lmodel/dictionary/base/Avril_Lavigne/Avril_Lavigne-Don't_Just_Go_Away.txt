<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Don't_Just_Go_Away">
You didn't care to leave me alone here
Damn you walk away like if everything okay
But you and i know that's not that way
Never seem to understand what the hell i'm trying to say
My dreams are turing into nightmare
My life is turing into hell 
Don't just walk away on me
Don't walk away and say everything is so  damn okay
We both know how this is gonna end at the end of the day
But you don't care and I won't care anymore
Now you try to say that we should start all over
I know that your trying to do i know better
And i know if i go away with you it won't last forever
My dreams are turing into nightmare
My life is turing into hell 
Don't just walk away on me
Don't walk away and say everything is so  damn okay
We both know how this is gonna end at the end of the day
But you don't care and I won't care anymore
Do you see everything so clear
Do you wish for me to go away and fade away
Tell me do you want to see that uh tell me
Don't just walk away on me
Don't walk away and say everything is so  damn okay
We both know how this is gonna end at the end of the day
But you don't care and I won't care anymore
Don't just walk away on me
Don't walk away and say everything is so  damn okay
We both know how this is gonna end at the end of the day
But you don't care and I won't care anymore
We both know at the end of the day it won't be okay
We both know at the end of the day it won't be okay
We both know at the end of the day it won't be okay
We both know at the end of the day it won't be okay
