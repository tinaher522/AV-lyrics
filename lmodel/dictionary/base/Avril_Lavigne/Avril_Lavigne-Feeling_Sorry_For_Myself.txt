<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Feeling_Sorry_For_Myself">
I'm feeling sorry for myself, 
every one is making fun of me. 
I have no friends, 
I'm a loner, 
and what else is there to do, 
but...
[Chorus]
feel sorry for myself, 
I'm feeling sorry for myself, 
I'm such a loner, 
I have no friends, 
what else is there to do, 
but feel sorry for myself,
ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah [x2]
no one likes me, 
I'm living on the streets, 
I have no parents, 
and I've split up with my band, 
what else is there to do, 
but...
[Chorus] 
feel sorry for myself, 
I'm feeling sorry for myself, 
I'm such a loner, 
I have no friends, 
what else is there to do, 
but feel sorry for myself
[Bridge] 
yeah yeah, 
I'm feeling, 
I'm feeling, 
I'm feeling sorry for myself, 
yeah yeah, 
yeah yeah, 
I'm feeling 
feeling 
sorry for myself
[Chorus]
feeling sorry for myself, 
feeling sorry for myself, 
nothing to do, 
nothing else to 
yeah yeah yeah 
nothing else to do, 
nothing else do but,
Feel Sorry For Myself
