<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Flag_Above_My_Door">
[Verse 1]
I know you'd question
How I can still love you
And still keep my head up
[Verse 2]
And since I won't say it
And I can't display it
Maybe I'll give up
Is it all just revenge with a hint of what you wish there was still?
And I could just pretend I don't have to face the facts, I think I will
[Chorus]
Well I will just lay myself down
I will put my hands up and surrender
There'll always be a flag above my door
I'm in love
I wish you could be . . .
[Verse 3]
And if we meet
Which I'm sure we will
And what was there
Is hidden still
I'll block the mem'ries
And hold my tongue
And we'll both act like
I've moved on . . .
[Chorus][x3]
