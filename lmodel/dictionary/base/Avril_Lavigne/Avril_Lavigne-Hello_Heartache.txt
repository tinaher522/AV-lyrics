<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Hello_Heartache">
La la la la la la la la 
You were perfect
I was unpredictable
It was more than worth it
But not too sensible
Young and foolish
Seemed to be the way
I was stupid
To think that I could stay
Oh oh
To think that I could stay
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It's not the end
It's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way
You will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la 
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la 
I was champagne
You were Jameson
Every bad thing
We did was so much fun
I've seen your best side
You got to see my worst
It's not the first time
But this one really hurts
Oh oh
Yeah this one's gonna, it hurts
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It's not the end
It's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way
But you will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 
Do you know
Do you get
It's just goodbye 
It's not the end
Do you know
Do you get
It's just goodbye 
It's not the end
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It's not the end
It's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way
But you will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 
Hello heartache
(Hello heartache)
Wish it didn't have to be this way
But you will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la
