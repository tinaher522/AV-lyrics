<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Destiny">
Destiny
searching for my destiny
not knowing where to look
searching all over the world
pointless, without a system
Where is my destiny?
Where and what is my destiny?
You will always know
that I'm looking for it with you
(chorus)
Is it in the sky?
Under the sea or on the ground?
In a wood or in the deserts?
On a mountain or in a valley?
Together we will find our destiny
Together we will search
All those years, looking
All those years, pointless
Why do I say it was pointless
Looking for it with you
I will give you the reason
My destiny...is you...
