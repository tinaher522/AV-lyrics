<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Won't_Let_You_Go">
When you're fire
Has turned to ashes
When you're screaming
You're heart is bleeding
When you're feeling 
Like there's no reason
I won't let you go
No, I won't let you go
It's when you're all alone and it's cold and there's noone to hold
When you're feeling lost and there's no where, There's no where to go
When you're feeling sad, don't forget you can reach for my hand 
When you're feeling down just remember...
