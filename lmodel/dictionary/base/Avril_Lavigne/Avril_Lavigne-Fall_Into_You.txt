<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Fall_Into_You">
You say you turned it off hid your heart upon a shelf 
scared of what it might cost to take it down for sombody else 
cause loving her you lost too much of yourself 
baby can't you see that she's not me
Not me at all 
And I need you to know you can fall into me 
that my arms are wide open and will always be 
right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me
Don't compare her to me,believe in love 
I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you 
I'll open up my soul if that is what you need me to do 
now baby its your move all you got to do is 
believe in love just believe in us 
And I need you to know you can fall into me 
that my arms are wide open and will always be 
right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me
Just believe in love,just believe in us 
Just believe in love just believe in us
Baby
I need you to know you can fall into me 
that my arms are wide open and will always be 
right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me
come and fall into me
baby fall into me
