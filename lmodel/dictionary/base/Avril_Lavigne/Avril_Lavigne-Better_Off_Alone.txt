<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Better_Off_Alone">
the morning is O.K. if I wake up lying next to you 
but mostly of the time ur away 
ur probably cheating on another girl 
and not even thinking of me 
oh boy oh boy I look in ur eyes 
oh boy oh boy and I realize 
oh boy oh boy 
i look in ur eyes and the morning is alright 
but I know that I love you 
and I can't let you cheat on me 
ur probably gonna say that i'm too young 
but I know what to do 
and i'm making this decision 
i think i'm better off alone 
how can you cheat on a sexy young lady 
who knows what to do when ur around 
you know that i'm against it 
and hate it when you leave me 
but I love you the bits 
but i'm not up for it 
oh boy oh boy I look in ur eyes 
oh boy oh boy and I realize 
oh boy oh boy 
i look in ur eyes and the morning is alright 
but I know that I love you 
and I can't let you cheat on me 
ur probably gonna say that i'm too young 
but I know what to do 
and i'm making this decision 
i think i'm better off alone 

when you'll say that you'll be home for 10 PM 
that don't mean in my eyes 7 AM 
(you know i'd liked to know wich bar you've bin at 
but I know you'll never tell me cuz you've got no respect 
ur too lazy to get ur ass off my parents couch 
but then I say you wanna beer 
than ur always up for that. 
you just can't get enough 
and you think you can handle it with just one touch 
but I know better let you know 
that i'm better off alone 
so please think again 
because this is the end 
but I know that I love you 
and I can't let you cheat on me 
ur probably gonna say that i'm too young 
but I know what to do 
and i'm making this decision 
i think i'm better off alone 
but I know that I love you 
and I can't let you cheat on me 
ur probably gonna say that i'm too young 
but I know what to do 
and i'm making this decision 
i think i'm better off alone 
but I know that I love you 
and I can't let you cheat on me 
ur probably gonna say that i'm too young 
but I know what to do 
and i'm making this decision 
i think i'm better off alone
