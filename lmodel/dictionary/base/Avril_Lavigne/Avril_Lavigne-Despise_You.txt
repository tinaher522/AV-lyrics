<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Despise_You">
Please go away
Leave me alone
To you I have nothing to say
My voice has no tone
I'd rather be there
Because you're here
Whatever, I dont care
Because of you there was a tear
No one cares about me
No one needs me
But dont you see
I do whatever you do to me
Do you hate me
'Cause I know I hate you
That's why I want you to stay away from me
You weren't the only one that I knew
Don't try to touch my feelings
Don't try to see whats on my mind
'Cause the last thing I'd do is let you 
Back in my life. I despise you
