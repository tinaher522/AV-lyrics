<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Meant_To_Be">
Oh I Know
Because I Found Out
All The Things In  Life
That Will Be Good To Me
Because I  Know If 
That Is Right
And You Were Meant To Be
I Will See The Tears 
Run Down You're Face 
As You're Leaving This Place
I Guess It 
Wasn't Meant To Be
But You Will Show Your
Face And That
Is Meant To Be Oh
La La La 
Oh I Know
You Were Wrong
About LIfe
And What Is Good To Me
You Once Will
Find Out
What Is Meant To Be
I Will See The Tears 
Run Down You're Face 
As You're Leaving This Place
I Guess It 
Wasn't Meant To Be
But You Will Show Your
Face And That
Is Meant To Be Oh

La La La 
One Day
You Will Find
A New Place
And It Will Be Better 
Better
Oh Oh Oh
You Were Meant To Be
I Will See The Tears 
Run Down You're Face 
As You're Leaving This Place
I Guess It 
Wasn't Meant To Be
But You Will Show Your
Face And That
Is Meant To Be Oh
La La La 
I Will See The Tears 
Run Down You're Face 
As You're Leaving This Place
I Guess It 
Wasn't Meant To Be
But You Will Show Your
Face And That
Is Meant To Be Oh
La La La 
(Piano Solo)
Meant To Be
