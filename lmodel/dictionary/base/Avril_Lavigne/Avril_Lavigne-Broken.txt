<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Broken">
Im broken, but no one knows
im just a poser, but ive brainwashed the world
no one will ever know how much of a poser i really am
'cause IM PUNK! i really am, watch me strum my guitar
IM PUNK hear me roar! im gonna break my guitar
now watch me as i sing my song
i sit hear singing my wannabe punk songs
they are really popish songs but soon they will be punk
'cause im cool like that
'cause im such a punk rawker!
'cause IM SEW PUNK! i really am watch me strum my guitar
IM PUNK HEAR ME ROAR im gonna break my guitar 
now watch me as i sing my song
I used to be a country singer
a cheerleader popular gurl
i never really liked all this punk rawk stuff
but i wanted to break free and be cool and start trends
but its all good, 'cause im just so punkie!
