<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Sippin'_On_Sunshine">
Boi you get me so high
Buzzin' like a beehive
Just a little kiss, but when it hits my lips, I'm sippin' on sunshine
Boi you looking so fly
Hotter than July
I just want to stay forever and a day sippin' on sunshine
Down at the beach holding my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby I want some more
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothing but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go
So we'll go with the flow
Yeah we're living the life
Sippin' on sunshine
Sippin' on sunshine
We-ooh-we-ooh-we-ooh 
Hey!
We-ooh-we-ooh-we-ooh
Oh!
We-ooh-we-ooh-we-ooh
Hey!
We-ooh-we-ooh-we
Sippin' on sunshine
You blowin' my mind
You got me up on Cloud Nine
Just a little taste, I wouldn't want to waste, a sip of that sunshine
We can kick it all night
Underneath the moonlight
But when the party ends, we'll do it all again, sippin' on sunshine
Down at the beach holding my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby I want some more
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothing but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go
So we'll go with the flow
Yeah we're living the life
Sippin' on sunshine
We-ooh-we-ooh-we-ooh 
Hey!
We-ooh-we-ooh-we-ooh
Sippin' on sunshine
We-ooh-we-ooh-we-ooh
Hey!
We-ooh-we-ooh-we
Sippin' on sunshine
(Sippin' on sunshine)
(Sippin' on sunshine)
(Sippin' on sunshine)
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
And it tastes so good
Nothing but a good time
A good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go
No we don't
So we'll go with the flow
Hell yeah
Yeah we're living the life
The life
Sippin' on sunshine
All day all night
Sippin' on sunshine
Yeah a good time
Everybody's just sipping on sunshine
Whoa Whoa Whoa 
Sippin' on sunshine
