<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="What_Life_Is">
(PIANO SOLO)
In a minute 
You Will Find Out
What Life Is 
Then You Will Stop And Take A Breath
And Realize What Life Is
Oh, What Am I To Do know?
Because It took to long to say
to you all about life and be kind
cuz' my life is mine
and I discovered What Life Is, Oh  
In An Hour
You Will Step Out To 
What Life Is 
Then You Listen
To Hear What Life Is
Oh, What Am I To Do know?
Because It took to long to say
to you all about life and be kind
cuz' my life is mine
and I discovered What Life Is, Oh 

Be In Your Life
It Belongs To You 
Oh, What Do I Do 
Cuz' You don't know
You Don't Know 3x
What Life Is
Oh, What Am I To Do know?
Because It took to long to say
to you all about life and be kind
cuz' my life is mine
and I discovered What Life Is, Oh 
Oh, What Am I To Do know?
Because It took to long to say
to you all about life and be kind
cuz' my life is mine
and I discovered What Life Is, Oh 
What Life Is
What Life is 
What Life Is 
What Life Is 
(Piano Solo)
