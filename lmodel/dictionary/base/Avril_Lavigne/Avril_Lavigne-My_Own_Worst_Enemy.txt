<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="My_Own_Worst_Enemy">
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that;
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me,Please tell me why?
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes oooon
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone gone 
( it begins hereÂ : )
It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy,
'cause every now and then I kick the living sh*t out of me
The smoke alarm is going off when there's a cigarette
Still burning 
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on 
I came in through the window last night 
And you're gone gone
Please tell me why 
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on 
I came in through the window last night
It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy
'cause every now and then I kick the living sh*t out of me
Can we forget about the the things I said when I was drunk
I didn't mean to call you that
