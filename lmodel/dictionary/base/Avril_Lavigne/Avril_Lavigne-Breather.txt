<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Breather">
Tell Me What You Do When Ya Don't know what 2 do oh 2x
Take A Little Piece And Runaway From Me Oh
Break A little part of your own time zone
Run To Far And You Breath To Hard
It's Time To Take A Breather
Ba Ba Ba Breather
Ha Ha Breath In And Out
Come On And Take A Breather
Ba Ba Breather   
Out Of Energy
Run Run Run Girl Run 
Stop 
Take A  Break 
Don't over work
It's Time To Take A Breather
Ba Ba Ba Breather
Ha Ha Breath In And Out
Come On And Take A Breather
Ba Ba Breather 

BREATH (YELL)
READY
EAT WELL
ALWAYS
TIME
HER OR HIM
EEEEEK
RIGHT ON
It's Time To Take A Breather
Ba Ba Ba Breather
Ha Ha Breath In And Out
Come On And Take A Breather
Ba Ba Breather 
It's Time To Take A Breather
Ba Ba Ba Breather
Ha Ha Breath In And Out
Come On And Take A Breather
Ba Ba Breather
