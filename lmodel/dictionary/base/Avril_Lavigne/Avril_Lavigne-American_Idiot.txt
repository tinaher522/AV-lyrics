<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="American_Idiot">
Don't want to be an American Idiot,
Don't want a nation under the new mania,
Can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension,
All across the alienation,
where everything isn't meant to be okay,
Television dreams of tomorrow,
We're not the ones meant to follow,
For that's enough to argue,
Well maybe I am the faggot America,
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda,
Now everybody do the propaganda!
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Don't want to be an American Idiot,
One nation controlled by the media,
Information age of hysteria,
It's calling out to idiot America
