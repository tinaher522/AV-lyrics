<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="In_The_End">
Do you ever feel
So perfect
You're not for real
But it's worth it
It seems like
Evrybody's friends
And in time
You know that this will end
But you're not thinking of how it should be done
So maybe you're losing your mind
[CHORUS]
And I can think of a thousand places
That I know I could be
But it's just one of those days
When I'm hopeless and useless but happy
Do you ever work out
How it could be done
I ain't got a doubt
I know this is the one
And if you feel
Like nothing will change
Stay for real
Reality's not out of your range
[CHORUS]
Another milestone
Or maybe not so
But still you can turn
You can burn
Or just go
But it all
Fills up
In the end
[CHORUS][x2]
Do you ever feel
So perfect
You're not for real
But it's worth it
In the end
