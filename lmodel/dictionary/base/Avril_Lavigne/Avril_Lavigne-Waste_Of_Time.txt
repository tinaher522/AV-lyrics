<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Waste_Of_Time">
time is valuable
mine is useless
next to you i feel nothing
nothing makes me fear
im me and im strong
i've a hard heart
it naver breaks
so,its waste of time attacking to me
ill never fall ill never die
i ask you if you love me
and you always lie and lie
crime is so bad
you are so mad
you try to make me 
exact like you baby
you will naver do it
you are fragile
you will be broken
