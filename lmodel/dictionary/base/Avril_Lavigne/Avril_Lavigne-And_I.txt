<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="And_I">
I am lost in the crowd
I'm standing in line
I'm feeling so down
And i am full of doubt
He's not the one
Take notice,hear me out
I want him, need him
And you, always will pull me through
I'm tired
This games so dumb
He never played, 
His race is won
I'm tired,
Can't smile no more
i'll sure cave in, just like before
I want him, need him
And you always will pull me through
And i want him, need him
And you always will pull me through
I want him, need him
And you always will pull me through
And i want him, need him
And you always will pull me through
And i...want him, need him
And i...want him, need him
And i...want him, need him
And i,...and i...and i
