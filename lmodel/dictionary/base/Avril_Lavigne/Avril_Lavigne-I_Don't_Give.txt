<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="I_Don't_Give">
Every time you go away 
It actually kinda makes my day
Every time you leave you slam the door 
You pick your words so carefully
You hate to think youÂ´re hurting me
You leave me laughing on the floor 
'Cause I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know
I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know 
I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that
I thought we were just hanging out
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?
You thought the way you taste would get me high
You went to all your friends to brag
Guys are always such a drag
Don't you know the reason that I kissed you was to say goodbye
'Cause I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know
I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know 
I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that
Hanging, hanging out
I am simply hanging, hanging out
I am simply hanging 
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?
Don't you know that I...
I don't give a damn about you
I don't give it up, not for you
I don't give a damn about you
I don't give it up, not for you
I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that
I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know
I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that
I dont give a damn
I don't give a shit
(I..) 
I don't give a
(I..I..)
What you say about that
(What you say)
You know
I don't give a damn
(I..) 
I don't give a shit
(I..I..)
What you say about that...
