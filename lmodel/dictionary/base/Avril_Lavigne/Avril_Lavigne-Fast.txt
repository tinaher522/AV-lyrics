<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Fast">
Fa fa fa 
Fast fast fast fast
Fast as you can
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fast
We are going to fast
I'm not ready to do it
Don't film me
Stop it
I need to get my cloths on
I'll smack you
In the head
With my skateboard
Fast, fast fast fast
We're goin' too fast
I don't want to have an
Orgasim I'm famouse
They'll know
It'll be in Sundays paper
Hey, I said stop filming!
