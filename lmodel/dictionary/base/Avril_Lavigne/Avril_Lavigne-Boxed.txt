<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Boxed">
Live It Up. I got something I need to share with you. Tell me it. I want to lose all the pieces. Lock Me up. I am the best thing in your life yeah. Screwed It up. Need A Head on your shoulder
But I will never trust you ever again 
because you boxed me. locked me all up. cuz' you hate me. I now hate you too and you love her and you   hate me but now I'm boxed and you are stuck with that brat.uh huh uh huh
lose me now. I'll just hate you again. Kick me down. I will get my revenge. Trust my head. I will hate you always. Hate her now. I guess you miss me,
But I will never trust you ever again 
because you boxed me. locked me all up. cuz' you hate me. I now hate you too and you love her and you   hate me but now I'm boxed and you are stuck with that brat.uh huh uh huh

Oh you made the wrong decision but love me always now. You better ditch her and hopefully never kissed her I still won't take you back we can be friends.
But I will never trust you ever again 
because you boxed me. locked me all up. cuz' you hate me. I now hate you too and you love her and you   hate me but now I'm boxed and you are stuck with that brat.uh huh uh huh
bbbbbb boxed me boxed me boxed me bbbbbb
I've been boxed
