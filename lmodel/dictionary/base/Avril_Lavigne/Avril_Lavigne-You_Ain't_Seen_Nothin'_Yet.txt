<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="You_Ain't_Seen_Nothin'_Yet">
First glance
You nearly made my jaw drop
First dance
And you were looking so hot
Held hands
And moved in for a lip lock
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby
First taste
Like honey you were so yum
Can't wait
For a second cause it so fun
Third base
And headed for home run
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby now
Hold on tight
To this rollercoaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Just let go
If you don't we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
My place
You showed up with flowers
Your face
Could stare at it for hours
Can't wait
To see your super powers
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby
Your car
I'm sitting right beside you
Rock star
At everything that you do
My heart
Is ready for the next move
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby now
Hold on tight
To this rollercoaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Just let go
If you don't we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on tight!
Hold on tight
To this rollercoaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Just let go
If you don't we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
