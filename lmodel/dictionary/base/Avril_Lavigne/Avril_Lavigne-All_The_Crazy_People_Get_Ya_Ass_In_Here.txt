<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="All_The_Crazy_People_Get_Ya_Ass_In_Here">
All the crazy people
Get ya ass in here
lets party till we drop
drinkin beer non stop
crazy, crazy in love
crazy people oh oh yeah
it was cool at the bar
when you kissed me on my cheek
but now i know what im worth
a real guy not a nasty geek

All the crazy people 
Get ya ass in here
lets party till we drop
drinkin beer non stop
crazy, crazy in love
all the crazy people 
out there yeah no oh
thought you were different
but i guess your da same
i thought you were special
it turned out that you're lame
