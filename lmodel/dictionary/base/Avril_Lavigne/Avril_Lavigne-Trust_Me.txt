Be Around Trust my Being.
Feel the pressure.
I am alive
Move around
and take it real so trust me
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along push me out of the way.
I am a human, just like you be with me and pull the pole. Live in our world beneath our cares
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along push me out of the way.

Oh so
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along push me out of the way.
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along push me out of the way.
I am alive
and take it real so trust me
