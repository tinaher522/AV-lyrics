<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Extinction">
People Running Down The
Street 
Blabbing To The Clubs And The Weird People
All About My Extinction
Oh It Makes Me So Mad
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 
I Am Not Extinct 
JUST TO LET YOU GO
This Is Not My Extinction
Hopefully It Won't For A Long Time For Now (now)
cuz' I am not extinct oh oh Extinction
People Walking In The Town
Running On The Floor
Blabbing To The World Of My Extinction
Oh It Makes Me So Sad
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 
I Am Not Extinct 

JUST TO LET YOU GO
This Is Not My Extinction
Hopefully It Won't For A Long Time For Now (now)
cuz' I am not extinct oh oh Extinction
YEAH YEAH
I WILL BE HERE FOR 100 MORE YEARS YEAH
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 
I Am Not Extinct 
JUST TO LET YOU GO
This Is Not My Extinction
Hopefully It Won't For A Long Time For Now (now)
cuz' I am not extinct oh oh Extinction
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 
I Am Not Extinct 
JUST TO LET YOU GO
This Is Not My Extinction
Hopefully It Won't For A Long Time For Now (now)
cuz' I am not extinct oh oh Extinction
