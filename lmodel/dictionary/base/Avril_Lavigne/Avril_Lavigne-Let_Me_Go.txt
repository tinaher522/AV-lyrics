<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Let_Me_Go">
Avril Lavigne
Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something, but now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember the pain of December
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late
Avril Lavigne &amp; Chad Kroeger
I'm breaking free from these memories
Got to let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Got to let it go, just let it go
Chad Kroeger
You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty
Like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me
Thought we were meant to be
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
Avril Lavigne &amp; Chad Kroeger:
I'm sorry it's too late
Avril Lavigne
I'm breaking free from these memories
Got to let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Got to let it go, just let it go
I let it go
Chad Kroeger
(And now I know)
Avril Lavigne
A brand new life
Chad Kroeger
(Is down this road)
Avril Lavigne
And when it's right
Chad Kroeger
(You always know)
Avril Lavigne
So this time
Chad Kroeger
(I won't let go)
Avril Lavigne
There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late
I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes
Led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Oh
Oh
Oh
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go
