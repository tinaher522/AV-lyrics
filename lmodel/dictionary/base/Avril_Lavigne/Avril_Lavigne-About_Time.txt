<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="About_Time">
You like keeping me waiting every night
You liked being the one who always starts the fight
And I'm always the one who tried to  make things alright
If so, so, so is how you wanna go
Then go leave if that's what you wanna do
I won't stop you, I'll be through with you
It was about time you decided to leave
The love I once used to have for you had already left
Long, long, long time ago
Secrets you keep and you try to black mail
Saying if I don't do what you want you'll send an email
I can't play you're little manipulating game again and again
Don't you see that all you do is try to hurt me
If so, so, so is how you wanna go
Then go leave if that's what you wanna do
I won't stop you, I'll be through with you
It was about time you decided to leave
The love I once used to have for you had already left
Long, long, long time ago
I kept pretending and wondering
If there was ever gonna be an ending
If so, so, so is how you wanna go
Then go leave if that's what you wanna do
I won't stop you, I'll be through with you
It was about time you decided to leave
The love I once used to have for you had already left
Long, long, long time ago
If so, so, so is how you wanna go
Then go leave if that's what you wanna do
I won't stop you, I'll be through with you
It was about time you decided to leave
The love I once used to have for you had already left
Long, long, long time ago
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
