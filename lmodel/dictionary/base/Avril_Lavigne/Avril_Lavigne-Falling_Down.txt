<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Falling_Down">
If fear's what makes us decide
Our future journey
Well I'm not along for the ride
Cause I'm still yearning 
To try and touch the sun
My finger's burning
Before you're old, you are young
Yeah, I'm still learning
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good
To hit the ground
You can watch me
Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down
I'm standing out in the street
The earth is moving
I feel it under my feet
And I'm still proving
That I can stand my ground
And my feet are there
Haven't washed my hair
To be lost before you are found
Don't mean you're losing
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good
To hit the ground
You can watch me
Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down
Someday I'll live in a house
Etc., etc., etc
But you know that's not for now
And for now I'm falling
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
(I am falling down)
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good
To hit the ground
You can watch me
Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down
I am falling down
(I'm falling..)
It feels so good
(I'm fallin, I'm falling down)
To hit the ground
I am falling downÂ…
