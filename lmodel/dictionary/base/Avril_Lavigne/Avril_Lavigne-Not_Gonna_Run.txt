<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Not_Gonna_Run">
I wake up in the morning
Put on my face
The one thats gonna
Get me through another day
It doesn't really matter 
...how i feel inside
...this life is like 
A game sometimes
But then you came around me
The walls just dissapeared
Nothing to surround me
And keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected see how I've opend up
Oh... you've made me trust
Cause I've never felt like this before 
I'm naked around you does it show 
You see right through me and I can't hide
I'm naked around you and it feels so right
... Yeah Yeah
I'm trying to remember why I was afraid
To be myself and let the covers fall away
Guess I never had someone like you 
To help me fit in my skin
I've never felt like this before 
I'm naked around you does it show 
You see right through me and I can't hide
I'm naked around you and it feels so right
I'm naked around you does it show
I'm so naked around you and I can't hide
You're gonna see right through me
Naked around you
I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide 
You're gonna see right through
