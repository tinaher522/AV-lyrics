"Knocking On Heavens Door"
Mama take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark too dark to see
And I'm feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' around
And I'm feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Feels like I'm
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Feels like I'm
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Feels like I'm
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Mama tell me
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Feels like I'm
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Feels like I'm
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
