<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Make-Up">
Layin' on the couch just,
hangin' with my boys
we're chillin' up the house tonight
I'm being myself
I'm nobody else â€˜cause
this is what we do alright
you'll always find
[Chorus]
I'm not wearing any make-up,
won't hide who I am,
I'll be what I am
I'm just being honest with my self once again
I'm my only friend
Kickin' off my shoes
I'm strummin' my guitar
I'm singin' songs about my life
if I could tell the truth
I'd tell you what I meant by
me, myself, and I
you'll always find
I'm not wearing any make-up,
won't hide who I am,
I'll be what I am
I'm just being honest with my self once again
I'm my only friend
No more mirrors
no more vanity
give it all away for free
donate to charity
I am happy in my skin
I try, in my heart it's not the same
you'll always find
I'm not wearing any make-up,
won't hide who I am,
I'll be what I am
I'm just being honest with my self once again
I'm my only friend
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight
