<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="I_Found_True_Love">
my heart is broken into 10,000 thousand pieces or more
cause you hurt me so much
when i found out i wasn't your one true life
it was with someone else
i cried every day every night 
cause i loved you so much
why does your heart get broken everytime you fall in love???
well you cannot back down to the one you found
you say you regret everything
should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind

i should have listen to my friends
when they said you're nothing
it wouldn't last to the end babe
never thought it would
i thought you were different
bye my love forever i'll miss you
we'll you're in the past now
you cannot back down to the one you found
you say you regret everything
should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind
you're out of my life now!
