<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Behind_Schedule">
[Verse 1]
Can I Get A Witness I've Been Doing This Since Way Back
Can I Get A Witness Are We Not Always On The Wrong Track
Can I Get A Witness To Testify That You And I Are Through
Now Love's Been on The Low Low I've Got Some Catching Up To Do
(So Me Say)
[Verse 2]
Baby It's You Taking Up Time Leaving Me Behind Schedule
Now I've Got Some Catching Up To Do
It's You Taking Up My Time
Leaving Me Behind Schedule
Now I've Got Some Catching Up To Do
[Verse 3]
Can I Get A Witness I'm No Rookie In The Game Of Love
Can I Get A Witness Playing Has Been Mostly With You
Can I Get A Witness to Testify I Feel So Much Better Now
Now Love's Been In The Low Low I've Got Some Catching Up To Do
(So Me Say)
[Chorus]
Wanna Testify Everything's In Order
Wanna Spread The Word Right Across The Border
Wanna Tell You That Everything Is Quite Allright
Letting Go Of You Is Gonna Make Me Wanna Sleep All Night
