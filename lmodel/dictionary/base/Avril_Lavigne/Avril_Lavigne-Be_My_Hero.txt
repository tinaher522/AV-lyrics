<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Be_My_Hero">
Let me go right now or i'll scream
Yup you know that i'm not your bitch
Remember the day you told me that i look like a witch
Will guess that witch is up in your friggen face
So now take your ass down and shut the hell up
I'm not in the mood to listen to your crap
Maybe right now it will be time to wrap you around
Just cos you save me doesn't mean a thing oh oh 
You wish i would call you a hero
Your not my hero nope i got better
You wish i scream out loud and say
You can be my hero today and the day and friday
You wish you can be my hero
Let's get thing right yah
My name is not April is Avril dumbass
Can you listen is not April is Avril with a v
Can i explain or you gonna blow me away
Please tell me something that i don't know anyway
My life is getting cold like a pizza in the oven
Maybe right now it will be time to wrap you around
Just cos you save me doesn't mean a thing oh oh 
You wish i would call you a hero
Your not my hero nope i got better
You wish i scream out loud and say
You can be my hero today and the day and friday
You wish you can be my hero
You wish you were my hero you wish
You cannot be my hero nope i got better
But you told me that you knew my precious secert
Maybe right now it will be time to wrap you around
Just cos you save me doesn't mean a thing oh oh 
You wish i would call you a hero
Your not my hero nope i got better
You wish i scream out loud and say
You can be my hero today and the day and friday
You wish you can be my hero
You wish i would call you a hero
Your not my hero nope i got better
You wish i scream out loud and say
You can be my hero today and the day and friday
You wish you can be my hero
