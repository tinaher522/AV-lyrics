<song artist="Avril_Lavigne" title="Take_It">
Just take it take it.
Can't take it take it.
I know what you do, flash me.
The way it's done, impolitely.
Just trying to find, some alone time.
No room to compromise.
Just take it take it.
Can't take it take it.
So sell your picture to a magazine, 
And they design true photography. 
Is that what you always wanted to be,
Well I'd be worried for you.
Sometimes, 
Gotta try, 
Run and hide, 
Get away from this.
I'll get by, 
In this life, 
This time.
Take your best shot, impress me.
Write a fictional story, for your fee.
Try to get the world, to believe.
Shocking headline surprise.
Just take it take it.
Can't take it take it.
So sell your picture to a magazine, 
And they design true photography. 
Is that what you always wanted to be,
Well I'd be sorry for you.
Sometimes, 
Gotta try, 
Run and hide, 
Get away from this.
I'll get by, 
In this life, 
This time.
You see me, 
I see you.
You're over there.
You see me, 
I see you.
So sell your picture to a magazine, 
And they design true photography. 
Is that what you always wanted to be,
Well I'd be sorry for you.
Sometimes, 
Gotta try to
Run and hide, 
Get away from shit.
Sometimes,
Gotta try,
Run and hide,
Get away from this.
