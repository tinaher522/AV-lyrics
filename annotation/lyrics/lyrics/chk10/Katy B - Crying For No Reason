I push all my problems to the back of my mind
Then they surface in my dreams, they come alive
I sweep all my issues to somewhere I can't find
And hope that I'll forget but there's just so many times

Why can't I be strong and just confront all my fears?
When the fear is hurting then I'm being insincere
But how many more days can I hide, how many years?
Emotions flooding then I was all seeming so clear

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking now?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force

I push all my problems to the back of my brain
The darkness deep inside where I just can't find my way
How can I walk with a smile, get on with my day?
When I deceive myself pretending it's all okay

I try my best to hold it all together, I know
The strings have worn away and now I'm all exposed
I try and hide it all the way on top of the shelf
I can lie to everyone but not to myself

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking now?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force

Forgive me now 'cause I said that I'll be there for you
Care for you, I let you down
I walked away 'cause there were things I couldn't say to you
Say to you, I'm breaking now

I burned some bridges down, there must be some way out
The voices speak so loud, will you forgive me now?
I burned some bridges down, there must be some way out
The voices speak so loud, will you forgive me now?

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking now?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
But I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force
