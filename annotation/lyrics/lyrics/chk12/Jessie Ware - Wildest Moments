"Now I miss him"
"Fighting"
"This time is the last time"

You and I, bloodlines
We come together every time
Two wrongs, no rights
We lose ourselves at night

From the outside
From the outside, everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try?

Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest
We could be the greatest
Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest
We could be the greatest
Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

Wait on thunder sky
Wherever there's smoke
There'll soon be fire
What could bring bad luck?
I've been looking at you too much

From the outside
From the outside, everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try?

Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest
We could be the greatest
Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest
We could be the greatest
Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

In the middle of it
We walk, we walk the line
Looking back on the sit
Our wildest moments
Are you thinking what if
What if we ruined it all?
My wrecking ball

From the outside
From the outside, everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try?

Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest
We could be the greatest
Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest
We could be the greatest
Baby, in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
