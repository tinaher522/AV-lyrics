Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
Work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Join me, I deserved it
No time to have you lurking
If I got right then you might like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nobody touch me, I'm the righteous
Nobody text me in a crisis

I believed all of your dreams are fruition
You took my heart and my keys and my vision
You took my heart off my sleeve, a decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation

All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been

But I wake up and everything's wrong
Just get ready for work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
Work, work, work, work, work, work

Duh, duh, duh, duh
For you I got
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Before the tables turned, turned, turned, turned

Begging, something please
Baby, don't you leave
Don't leave me stuck here in the streets (no, no)

If I get another chance to
I will never, no never neglect you
I mean, who am I to hold your past against you?
I just hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this through
I hope that you see this true
What can I say?
Please recognize I'm trying baby

I been work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
I work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done
That'll work, come over
We just need that slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one

Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over

Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me
Oh yeah, I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
How many more shots until you're rolling?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the

Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
Work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Work, work, work
