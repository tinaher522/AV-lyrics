When I waited for you there was no show
Made myself believe the untrue, how could I not know?
But it seemed easier, just to lie
But I found you out, this is my last goodbye

I heard enough fairy tales back in my youth
So just stop biting your nails and take the painful truth
You just look ridiculous in your disguise
Well I found you out, this is my last goodbye

'Cause it used to be my life and soul
Keeping everything in tune
What the heck man
Last time I checked man
We had it all, it was just me and you
So what happened to you
Thought I knew you
No more chances
I'm gone, gone, gone

Love is not blind, it's just deaf and it is dumb
So how could I fool myself thinking you were the one
How sad, how undignified
Now I found you out, this is my last goodbye

'Cause it used to be my life and soul
Keeping everything in tune
What the heck man
Last time I checked man
We had it all, it was just me and you
So what happened to you
Thought I knew you
No more chances
I'm gone, gone, gone
Don't wait for me
I'll be gone

'Cause when I waited for you there was no show
Made myself believe the untrue, how could I not know?

'Cause it used to be my life and soul
Keeping everything in tune
What the heck man
Last time I checked man
We had it all, it was just me and you
So what happened to you
Thought I knew you
No more chances
I'm gone and gone and gone and gone

'Cause it used to be my life and soul
Keeping everything in tune
What the heck man
Last time I checked man
We had it all, it was just me and you
So what happened to you
I thought I knew you
No more chances
I'm gone, gone,
I'm gone, gone, gone
