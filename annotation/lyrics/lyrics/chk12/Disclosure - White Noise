I know you’re smart
You spin me round like an art
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes it’s fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me on to one

Lately I’ve been thinking 
If you wanna get tough
Then let’s play rough
Lately I’ve been thinking 
If you wanna get tough
Then let’s play rough

I don’t need you 
Giving it straight to me 
Giving it straight to me 
You just gotta get my back 
I don’t need you
Telling me how to be 
Telling me how to be 
You just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back

Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I’m hearing static, you’re like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I’m hearing static, you’re like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me, tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain
You got me washed out, washed out, colour drained

Lately I’ve been thinking 
If you wanna get tough
Then let’s play rough
Lately I’ve been thinking 
If you wanna get tough
Then let’s play rough

I don’t need you 
Giving it straight to me 
Giving it straight to me 
You just gotta get my back 
I don’t need you
Telling me how to be 
Telling me how to be 
You just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Just gotta get my back 
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back

Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back

All I hear is 
All I hear is 
All I hear is 
All I hear is 

All I hear is 
All I hear is 
All I hear is 
All I hear is 

Just noise, white noise 
Just noise, white noise 
I’m hearing static, you’re like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

Hear me crying
Hear me crying
