Feel good...
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good

Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're damned as free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss because I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

De La Soul
Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining them up like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear reppin' in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahaa
Yo, we goin' ghost town
This Motown,
With yo sound
You in the blink
Gon bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo sound
You kill the Inc.
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you jet ahead
Yo, watch the way I navigate
Hahahahahaa

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

De La Soul
Don't stop, shit it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
Hahahahahaa
Don't stop, shit it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
