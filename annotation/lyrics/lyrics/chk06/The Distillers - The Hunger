Holy eyes, I never knew I'd beg down at your feet
Hold on tight, I never knew I'd know much more than this
Open sky, the wave of pain, the scent of you is bliss
Hungry eyes, they stare at me, I know, I know
Don't go!

Summertime, the taste of saint secretes a perfume mist
Console the mind, I take it in, with lips of pink I kiss
Lonely sky, the more you take the more that I give in
Holy eyes, I never knew, I know, I know
Don't go!

Hold onto the memory, it's all you've got
I know you'll be there to soak up blood lost, blood lost, blood loss

Don't go!

Hold onto the memory, it's all you've got
I know you'll be there to soak up blood lost
Hold onto the memory, it's all you've got
I know you'll be there to soak up blood lost, blood lost, blood loss

I miss you
I miss you
