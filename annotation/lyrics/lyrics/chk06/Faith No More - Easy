I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed
Yeah, ooh

That's why I'm easy (aah, aah, aah, aah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning (aah, aah, aah, aah)
That's why I'm easy (aah, aah, aah, aah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free, just me
Oh baby
Ooh

Oh, ooh
That's why I'm easy (aah, aah, aah, aah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah yeah (aah, aah, aah, aah)
That's why I'm easy (aah, aah, aah, aah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning
