It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
Because I'm happy Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Yeah Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news talking this and that
Give me all you got, don't hold back
Well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time
Here's why
Because I'm happy Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Yeah Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
bring me down, can't nothin'
bring me down, your love is too high
to bring me down, can't nothin'
bring me down, I said tell you now
bring me down, can't nothin'
bring me down, your love is too high
to bring me down, can't nothin'
bring me down, I said
Because I'm happy Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Yeah Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do do do
