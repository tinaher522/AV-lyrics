I don't want to be your leader
I don't want to let you down
And I don't even need to see you
Turn your life around

Are you running away?
Cause someone told you never
That you're always gonna tread the wrong road
Are you running away?
Could my love do you better?
Cause there's something that I need to let you know

If you're looking for a place to hide, it's alright
I will always try and look the other way
And if you're ever caught between the lines, wrong or right
We are one and I will always keep you safe

Back into the habit
I see it in your eyes
Gone through all the motions
It's hard to recognize

That you're running away
And and can't escape forever
From the memories you tried to leave behind
We could've found a way
We could've been in it together
So I'm reaching out and here's the reason why

If you're looking for a place to hide, it's alright
I will always try and look the other way
And if you're ever caught between the lines, wrong or right
We are one and I will always keep you safe
