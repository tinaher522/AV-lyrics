Do you like drugs?
Have you ever felt alone?
Do you still believe in love?

But do you like drugs, do you like drugs?
Yeah? Well me too, me too (Me too babe)
Me too, me too
Do you like love, do you like love?
Yeah? Well me too, me too
It’s what we gonna do

What about matinee movies, pointless secrets
Midnight summers, swim private beaches
Rock, paper, scissors--wait! Best out of three
Mama said the greatest things in life are free
What about lust, and what about trust?
What about fun?
She said, you know that I do
Oh you do baby, hope you do now
You do, do, do, do

Do you like drugs, do you like drugs?
Yeah? Well me too, me too
Me too, me too
Do you like love, do you like love?
Well me too, me too
It’s what we gonna do

Tonight, so let’s dance a little harder
Till I feel like I know
All the things

Do you like drugs, do you like drugs?
Yeah? Well me too, me too
Me too, me too
Do you like hugs? Do you like love?
Oh, I feel like we got so much in common now (Yeah? Me too)
Right about now baby (Me too)
Me too, me too
It’s what we gonna do
It’s you and me
Yeah, tonight
You and me tonight
You and me tonight
You and me tonight
You and me yeah, tonight
You and me tonight
Oh, I feel like I’ve known you for so long right about now baby
Yeah, yeah
I wanna do you like drugs tonight

Wanna do you like drugs, oh oh...
