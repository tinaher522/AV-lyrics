So sick of crocodile tears
Tears, crocodile tears

You call up and tell me, you haven't slept for days.
You say you've been home crying, in your pillow case

You're a record on repeat, the title track's apology and
I Know it all by heart
Your mouth is a conveyor belt of I'm so sorry
I need help, and I think it's time we part.

Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of need you so
I've had enough of Us, us
Why don't you turn off the crocodile tears
Honestly save them for someone who cares
Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of

Crocodile tears
So sick of crocodile tears
Tears, crocodile tear

You say you're feeling lonely, sitting by yourself
You should have thought of that before you, slept with someone else

You're a record on repeat, the title tracks forgive me please
and I know it all by heart.
Your mouth is a conveyer belt of it meant nothing
You just felt so bad
It don't matter I'm not mad.

Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of need you so
I've had enough of Us, us
Why don't you turn off the crocodile tears
Honestly save them for someone who cares
Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of

Crocodile tears
So sick of crocodile tears
Tears, crocodile tear
