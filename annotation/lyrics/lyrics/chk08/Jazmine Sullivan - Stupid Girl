I'm a fool
And he loves it
He knows he's got me wrapped around his fingers with a glance
I do whatever he says
If he wants it
He gives a smile that snaps my little heart into a trance

Boys have toys too
You know they do
They call us stupid girls
They call us stu-u-u-u-pid girls
And when you love 'em like I do
You'll be a fool
You'll be a stupid girl
You'll be a stu-u-u-u-pid girl

Men roam the world
Looking for us
Someone they can fuck around with
Make us really trust them
And we never have a clue
We never see it comin'
Trainwreck headed for us
But we never think of runnin'
So which one are you
Because I know who I am
And you have to choose
To use your head or be a stupid girl
What will it be
Don't wanna end up like me-e-e-e
So use your head don't be a stupid gi-i-I-rl

You know they do
They call us stupid girls
They call us stu-u-u-u-pid girls
And when you love 'em like I do
You'll be a fool
You'll be a stupid girl
You'll be a stu-u-u-u-pid girl

Better learn from my mistakes
Because it isn't too late
For you to get up and run
Please just don't be dumb
Cause you have a choice
T-to run after the boys
Or take over the world
Don't be a stupid gi-i-i-irl

They call us stu-u-u-u-pid girls
And when you love 'em like I do
You'll be a fool
You'll be a stupid girl
You'll be a stu-u-u-u-pid girl

Boys have toys too
You know they do
They call us stupid girls
They call us stu-u-u-u-pid girls
And when you love 'em like I do
You'll be a fool
You'll be a stupid girl
You'll be a stu-u-u-u-pid girl
