abstract = {The breadth of expression in singing depends on fine control of physiology and acoustics. In this review, the basic concepts from speech acoustics, including the source-filter model, models of the glottal source and source-filter interactions, are described. The precise control, the extended pitch range, the timbre control and, in some cases, the uses of alternate phonation modes all merit further attention and explanation. Here we review features of the singing voice and the understanding that has been delivered by new measurement techniques. We describe the glottal mechanisms and the control of vocal tract resonances used in singing. We review linear and nonlinear components of the voice and the way in which they are measured and modelled and discuss the aero-acoustic models. We conclude with a list of open questions and active fields of research.},

@article{Krumhansl2000,
abstract = {Rhythm and pitch are the 2 primary dimensions of music. They are interesting psychologically because simple, well-defined units combine to form highly complex and varied patterns. This article brings together the major developments in research on how these dimensions are perceived and remembered, beginning with psychophysical results on time and pitch perception. Progressively larger units are considered, moving from basic psychological categories of temporal and frequency ratios, to pulse and scale, to metrical and tonal hierarchies, to the formation of musical rhythms and melodies, and finally to the cognitive representation of large-scale musical form. Interactions between the dimensions are considered, and major theoretical proposals are described. The article identifies various links between musical structure and perceptual and cognitive processes, suggesting psychological influences on how sounds are patterned in music.},

abstract = {The singing power ratio (SPR) is an objective means of quantifying the singer's formant. SPR has been shown to differentiate trained singers from nonsingers and sung from spoken tones. This study was designed to evaluate SPR and acoustic parameters in singing students to determine if the singer-in-training has an identifiable difference between sung and spoken voices. Digital audio recordings were made of both sung and spoken vowel sounds in 55 singing students for acoustic analysis. SPR values were not significantly different between the sung and spoken samples. Shimmer and noise-to-harmonic ratio were significantly higher in spoken samples. SPR analysis may provide an objective tool for monitoring the student's progress.},

abstract = {This paper presents a parameter for objectively evaluating singing voice quality. Power spectrum of vowel sound / a / was analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform. The greatest harmonics peak between 2 and 4 kHz and the greatest harmonics peak between 0 and 2 kHz were identified. Power ratio of these peaks, termed singing power ratio (SPR), was calculated in 37 singers and 20 nonsingers. SPR of sung / a / in singers was significantly greater than in nonsingers. In singers, SPR of sung / a / was significantly greater than that of spoken / a /. By digital signal processing, power spectrum of sung / a / was varied, and the processed sounds were perceptually analyzed. SPR had a significant relationship with perceptual scores of “ringing” quality. SPR provides an important quantitative measurement for evaluating singing voice quality for all voice types, including soprano.},

@article{Quinn2006,
abstract = {Tempo is one factor that is frequently associated with the expressive nature of a piece of music. Composers often indicate the tempo of a piece of music through the use of numerical markings (beats min(-1)) and subjective terms (adagio, allegro). Three studies were conducted to assess whether listeners were able to make consistent judgments about tempo that varied from piece to piece. Listeners heard short extracts of Scottish music played at a range of tempi and were asked to make a two-alternative forced choice of "too fast" or "too slow" for each extract. The responses for each study were plotted as proportion of too fast responses as a function of tempo for each piece, and cumulative normal curves were fitted to each data set. The point where these curves cross 0.5 is the tempo at which the music sounds right to the listeners, referred to as the optimal tempo. The results from each study show that listeners are capable of making consistent tempo judgments and that the optimal tempo varies across extracts. The results also revealed that rhythm plays a role, but not the only role in making temporal judgments.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of singing tempo during specific song acquisition of preschool aged children. The study had two research questions: 1. What is the effect of slow and fast singing tempos on preschool children's performance of musical components (melody, rhythm, and text, individually and combined) of a duple major song over time? 2. Will children's performance tempo be the same as or similar to the presented instructional tempo? Participants were randomly assigned by classroom to Tempo Group A (120 beats per minute) or Tempo Group B (60 bpm). A three week pilot study ( N = 14) validated the teaching procedures, recording procedures, and the scoring rubric. During the six week main study, participants ( N = 50) were exposed to the song 30 times. Three judges evaluated individual performance recordings from the pilot study and the individual midpoint and final performances from the main study in three dimensions: melody, rhythm, and text. Interjudge reliabilities were calculated using a Pearson product moment reliability. Data analysis used a two-way Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) with repeated measures for the individual components and an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures for the composite score. The melodic scores, the rhythmic scores, the text scores, and the composite scores showed statistically significant growth for both groups from the week three recordings to the week six recordings. There was no statistically significant difference between the instructional tempo groups. The mean of complete performances for both tempo treatment groups moved toward the center of the tempo range (60–120 bpm) Using a t -test, the change in performance tempo from instructional tempo was statistically significant. Further research is needed for specialized groups (English as a Second Language, developmental delays, and different tonalities/meters).},
