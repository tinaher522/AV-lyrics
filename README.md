## Introduction to the project.

This project is extended by an MSc project that ran last year called ‘Automatic Speech Recognition in Music’.  
Aim to develop an AV-ASR system with HMM-GMM methodologies in music based on the Audio-only ASR system that ran last year.

The experiments are implemented using Kaldi tools with opencv and dlib. The database were constructed using videos of popular music obtained from YouTube. The Language Model were constructed using the lyrics of the dicographies of several artist. The Acoustic Model were based in a subset of cmudict.
